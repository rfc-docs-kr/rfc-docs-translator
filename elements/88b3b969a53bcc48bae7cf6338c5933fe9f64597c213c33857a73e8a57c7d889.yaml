          Figure 7 shows the resulting link-state database for the Area 1.
          The figure completely describes that area's intra-area routing.
          It also shows the complete view of the internet for the two
          internal routers RT1 and RT2.  It is the job of the area border
          routers, RT3 and RT4, to advertise into Area 1 the distances to
          all destinations external to the area.  These are indicated in
          Figure 7 by the dashed stub routes.  Also, RT3 and RT4 must
          advertise into Area 1 the location of the AS boundary routers
          RT5 and RT7.  Finally, AS-external-LSAs from RT5 and RT7 are
          flooded throughout the entire AS, and in particular throughout
          Area 1.  These LSAs are included in Area 1's database, and yield
          routes to Networks N12-N15.
