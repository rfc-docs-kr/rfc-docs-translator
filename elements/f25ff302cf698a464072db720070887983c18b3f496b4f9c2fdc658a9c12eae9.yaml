      [15]This is the way RFC 1583 specified point-to-point
      representation.  It has three advantages: a) it does not require
      allocating a subnet to the point-to-point link, b) it tends to bias
      the routing so that packets destined for the point-to-point
      interface will actually be received over the interface (which is
      useful for diagnostic purposes) and c) it allows network
      bootstrapping of a neighbor, without requiring that the bootstrap
      program contain an OSPF implementation.
