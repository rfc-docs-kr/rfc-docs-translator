        This Informational RFC described the implications of CIDR
        deployment in 1995; it notes that formerly-classful addresses were
        to be allocated using CIDR mechanisms and describes the use of a
        default route for non-CIDR-aware sites.  With the full deployment
        of CIDR on the Internet, such scenarios are no longer
        operationally relevant.
