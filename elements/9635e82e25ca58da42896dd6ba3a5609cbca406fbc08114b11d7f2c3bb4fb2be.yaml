     This document has been produced by the IRTF Information-Centric
     Networking Research Group (ICNRG).  The main objective of the ICNRG
     is to couple ongoing ICN research in the above areas with solutions
     that are relevant for evolving the Internet at large.  The ICNRG
     produces documents that provide guidelines for experimental
     activities in the area of ICN so that different, alternative
     solutions can be compared consistently, and information sharing can
     be accomplished for experimental deployments.  This document
     incorporates input from ICNRG participants and their corresponding
     text contributions; it has been reviewed by several ICNRG active
     participants (see the Acknowledgments), and represents the consensus
     of the research group.  That said, note that this document does not
     constitute an IETF standard; see also [RFC5743].
