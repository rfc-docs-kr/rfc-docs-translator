     EAP methods MAY support authentication based on shared secrets.  If
     the shared secret is a passphrase entered by the user,
     implementations MAY support entering passphrases with non-ASCII
     characters.  In this case, the input should be processed using an
     appropriate stringprep [RFC3454] profile, and encoded in octets using
     UTF-8 encoding [RFC2279].  A preliminary version of a possible
     stringprep profile is described in [SASLPREP].
