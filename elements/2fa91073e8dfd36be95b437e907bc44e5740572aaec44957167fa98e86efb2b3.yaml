        Tutorial: This concept was described in the Anderson report. A
        reference monitor should be (a) complete (i.e., it mediates every
        access), (b) isolated (i.e., it cannot be modified by other system
        entities), and (c) verifiable (i.e., small enough to be subjected
        to analysis and tests to ensure that it is correct).

  - 튜토리얼: 이 개념은 Anderson 보고서에 설명되어 있습니다. 참조 모니터는 (a) 완전해야 하며(즉, 모든 액세스를 중재함), (b) 격리되어 있어야 하며(즉, 다른 시스템 엔터티에 의해 수정될 수 없음), (c) 검증 가능해야 합니다(즉, 분석 대상이 될 만큼 작아야 함). 그리고 그것이 올바른지 확인하기 위해 테스트합니다).
