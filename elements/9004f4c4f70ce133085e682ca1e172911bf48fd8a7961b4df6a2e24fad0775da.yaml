              Since the subnet mask appropriate to the destination address
              is generally not known, a Network Redirect message SHOULD be
              treated identically to a Host Redirect message; i.e., the
              cache entry for the destination host (only) would be updated
              (or created, if an entry for that host did not exist) for
              the new gateway.
