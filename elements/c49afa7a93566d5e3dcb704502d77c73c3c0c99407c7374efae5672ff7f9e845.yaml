        When using single exchange of ASPSM, what is seen as a
        simplification, only the activation phase (ASPTM messages) is
        independent for each of the two directions.  In this case, it
        could happen that the sending of the ASPSM from IPSP-A or IPSP-B
        could have an effect in the whole communication, as it is defined
        in the standard SG-AS communication.
