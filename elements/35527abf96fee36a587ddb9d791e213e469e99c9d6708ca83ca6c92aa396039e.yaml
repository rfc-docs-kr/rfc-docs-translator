        If we assume that incoming traffic (coming from outside of MBII,
        with a destination within MBII) is always to enter via the nearest
        point to the destination, then each TRD which has a connection to
        MBII needs to announce to other TRDs the ability to reach only
        those parts of MBII whose address is taken from its own address
        space. This implies that no additional routing information needs
        to be exchanged between TRDs, resulting in a smaller load on the
        inter-domain routing tables maintained by TRDs when compared to
        the first solution. This solution therefore scales better to
        extremely large internets containing very large numbers of multi-
        homed organizations.
