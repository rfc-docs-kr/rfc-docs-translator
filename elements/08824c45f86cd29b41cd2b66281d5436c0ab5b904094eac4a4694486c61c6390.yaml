     1.  For datagrams destined to a RPL router, the router processes the
         packet in the usual way.  For instance, if the SRH was included
         using tunneled mode and the RPL router serves as the tunnel
         endpoint, the router removes the outer IPv6 header, at the same
         time removing the SRH as well.
