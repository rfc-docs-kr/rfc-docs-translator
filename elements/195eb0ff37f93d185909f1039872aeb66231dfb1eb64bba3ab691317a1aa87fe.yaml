     For example, the legacy "Class B" network 172.16.0.0, with an implied
     network mask of 255.255.0.0, is defined as the prefix 172.16.0.0/16,
     the "/16" indicating that the mask to extract the network portion of
     the prefix is a 32-bit value where the most significant 16 bits are
     ones and the least significant 16 bits are zeros.  Similarly, the
     legacy "Class C" network number 192.168.99.0 is defined as the prefix
     192.168.99.0/24; the most significant 24 bits are ones and the least
     significant 8 bits are zeros.
