     At startup or restart phases, an SGP or IPSP, upon receipt of an ASP
     Active message for the first ASP in a Loadshare AS, SHOULD NOT direct
     traffic to a newly active ASP until it determines that there are
     sufficient resources to handle the expected load (e.g., until there
     are "n" ASPs in state ASP-ACTIVE in the AS).  In this case, the SGP
     or IPSP SHOULD withhold the Notify (AS-ACTIVE) until there are
     sufficient resources.
