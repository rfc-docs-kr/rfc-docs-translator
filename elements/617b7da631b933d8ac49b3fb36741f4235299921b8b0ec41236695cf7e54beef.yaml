          At this point, an attempt is made to match the source of the
          Hello Packet to one of the receiving interface's neighbors.  If
          the receiving interface connects to a broadcast, Point-to-
          MultiPoint or NBMA network the source is identified by the IP
          source address found in the Hello's IP header.  If the receiving
          interface connects to a point-to-point link or a virtual link,
          the source is identified by the Router ID found in the Hello's
          OSPF packet header.  The interface's current list of neighbors
          is contained in the interface's data structure.  If a matching
          neighbor structure cannot be found, (i.e., this is the first
          time the neighbor has been detected), one is created.  The
          initial state of a newly created neighbor is set to Down.
