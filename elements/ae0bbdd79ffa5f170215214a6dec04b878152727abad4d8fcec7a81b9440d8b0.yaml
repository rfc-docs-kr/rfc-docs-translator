     Not All applications lend themselves easily to address translation by
     NAT devices. Especially, the applications that carry IP address (and
     TU port, in case of NAPT) inside the payload. Application Level
     Gateways, or ALGs must be used to perform translations on packets
     pertaining to such applications. ALGs may optionally utilize address
     (and TU port) assignments made by NAT and perform translations
     specific to the application. The combination of NAT functionality and
     ALGs will not provide end-to-end security assured by IPsec.  However,
     tunnel mode IPsec can be accomplished with NAT router serving as
     tunnel end point.
