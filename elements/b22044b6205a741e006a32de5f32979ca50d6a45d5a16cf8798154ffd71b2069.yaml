     The JPEG standard defines four modes of operation: the sequential DCT
     mode, the progressive DCT mode, the lossless mode, and the
     hierarchical mode.  Depending on the mode, the image is represented
     in one or more passes.  Each pass (called a frame in the JPEG
     standard) is further broken down into one or more scans.  Within each
     scan, there are one to four components, which represent the three
     components of a color signal (e.g., "red, green, and blue", or a
     luminance signal and two chrominance signals).  These components can
     be encoded as separate scans or interleaved into a single scan.
