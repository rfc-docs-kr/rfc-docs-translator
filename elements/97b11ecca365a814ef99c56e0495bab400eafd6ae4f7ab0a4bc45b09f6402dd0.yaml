     [RFC-2228] states that the user must reauthorize (that is, reissue
     some or all of the USER, PASS, and ACCT commands) following an AUTH
     command.  Additionally, this document specifies that all other
     transfer parameters (other than the AUTH parameter) must be reset,
     almost as if a REIN command was issued.
