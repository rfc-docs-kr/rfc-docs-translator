     When a redirect agent receives a request whose routing entry is set
     to REDIRECT, it MUST reply with an answer message with the 'E' bit
     set, while maintaining the Hop-by-Hop Identifier in the header, and
     include the Result-Code AVP to DIAMETER_REDIRECT_INDICATION.  Each of
     the servers associated with the routing entry are added in a separate
     Redirect-Host AVP.
