     Some field bodies in this standard are defined simply as
     "unstructured" (which is specified below as any US-ASCII characters,
     except for CR and LF) with no further restrictions.  These are
     referred to as unstructured field bodies.  Semantically, unstructured
     field bodies are simply to be treated as a single line of characters
     with no further processing (except for header "folding" and
     "unfolding" as described in section 2.2.3).

  이 표준의 일부 필드 본문은 추가 제한 없이 간단히 "구조화되지 않은"(CR 및 LF를 제외한 모든 US-ASCII 문자로 아래에 지정됨)로 정의됩니다.  이를 구조화되지 않은 필드 바디라고 합니다.  의미상 구조화되지 않은 필드 본문은 추가 처리 없이 단순히 한 줄의 문자로 처리됩니다(섹션 2.2.3에 설명된 헤더 "접기" 및 "펼치기" 제외).
