              The router-LSA then describes the router's working
              connections (i.e., interfaces or links) to the area.  Each
              link is typed according to the kind of attached network.
              Each link is also labelled with its Link ID.  This Link ID
              gives a name to the entity that is on the other end of the
              link.  Table 18 summarizes the values used for the Type and
              Link ID fields.
