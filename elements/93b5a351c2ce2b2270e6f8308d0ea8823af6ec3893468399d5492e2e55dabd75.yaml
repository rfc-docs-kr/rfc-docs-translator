     ObservedEvents is supplied with the Notify command to inform the MGC
     of which event(s) were detected.  Used with the AuditValue command,
     the ObservedEventsDescriptor returns events in the event buffer which
     have not been Notified. ObservedEvents contains the RequestIdentifier
     of the EventsDescriptor that triggered the notification, the event(s)
     detected and the detection time(s). Detection times are reported with
     a precision of hundredths of a second.  Time is expressed in UTC.
