          Area border routers
              A router that attaches to multiple areas.  Area border
              routers run multiple copies of the basic algorithm, one copy
              for each attached area. Area border routers condense the
              topological information of their attached areas for
              distribution to the backbone.  The backbone in turn
              distributes the information to the other areas.
