        DISCUSSION
             Although the IP layer does not generally know link layer
             addresses (since every different network medium typically has
             a different address format), the broadcast address on a
             broadcast-capable medium is an important special case.  See
             Section 3.2.2, especially the DISCUSSION concerning broadcast
             storms.
