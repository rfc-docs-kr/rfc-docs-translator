     It is important to maintain clear administrative boundaries between
     the SP and its customers (cf. [4]).  The PE and P routers should be
     administered solely by the SP, and the SP's customers should not have
     any management access to it.  The CE devices should be administered
     solely by the customer (unless the customer has contracted the
     management services out to the SP).

  SP와 고객 간에 명확한 관리 경계를 유지하는 것이 중요합니다(참조 [4]). PE 및 P 라우터는 SP에서만 관리해야 하며 SP 고객은 이에 대한 관리 액세스 권한이 없어야 합니다. CE 장치는 고객에서만 관리해야 합니다(고객이 SP에 관리 서비스를 계약한 경우는 제외).
