     [RFC2324] was an April 1 RFC that lampooned the various ways HTTP was
     abused; one such abuse was the definition of an application-specific
     418 status code, which has been deployed as a joke often enough for
     the code to be unusable for any future use.

  [RFC2324]는 HTTP가 남용되는 다양한 방식을 풍자한 4월 1일 RFC였습니다. 그러한 남용 중 하나는 애플리케이션별 418 상태 코드의 정의였으며, 이는 코드를 나중에 사용할 수 없을 만큼 자주 농담으로 배포되었습니다.
