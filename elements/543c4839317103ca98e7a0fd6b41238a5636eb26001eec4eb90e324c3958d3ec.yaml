     In the simplest sense, the change from Class A/B/C network numbers to
     classless prefixes is to make explicit which bits in a 32-bit IPv4
     address are interpreted as the network number (or prefix) associated
     with a site and which are the used to number individual end systems
     within the site.  In CIDR notation, a prefix is shown as a 4-octet
     quantity, just like a traditional IPv4 address or network number,
     followed by the "/" (slash) character, followed by a decimal value
     between 0 and 32 that describes the number of significant bits.
