     Each AFm class applies a Two Rate Three Color Meter, dividing traffic
     into three groups.  If two rates R and S, where R < S, are specified
     and traffic arrives at rate T, traffic comprising up to R bits per
     second is considered to conform to the "confirmed" rate, R.  If
     R < T, traffic comprising up to S-R bits per second is considered to
     conform to the "excess" rate, S.  Any further excess is non-
     conformant.
