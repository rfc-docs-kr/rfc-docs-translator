     Certificate pinning is only appropriate during Mail Account setup and
     MUST NOT be offered as an option in response to a failed certificate
     validation for an existing Mail Account.  An MUA that allows
     certificate pinning MUST NOT allow a certificate pinned for one
     account to validate connections for other accounts.  An MUA that
     allows certificate pinning MUST also allow a user to undo the
     pinning, i.e., to revoke trust in a certificate that has previously
     been pinned.
