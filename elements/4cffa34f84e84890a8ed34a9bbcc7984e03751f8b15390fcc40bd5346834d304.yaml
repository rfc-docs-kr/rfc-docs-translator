     This specification intends to improve this situation by requiring the
     explicit configuration of both BGP Import and Export Policies for any
     External BGP (EBGP) session such as customers, peers, or
     confederation boundaries for all enabled address families.  Through
     codification of the aforementioned requirement, operators will
     benefit from consistent behavior across different BGP
     implementations.
