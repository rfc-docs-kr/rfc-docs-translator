     Validating the authenticity of a message involves a bitwise
     comparison of the calculated tag with the received tag.  In most use
     cases, nonces and AAD contents are not "used up" until a valid
     message is received.  This allows an attacker to send multiple
     identical messages with different tags until one passes the tag
     comparison.  This is hard if the attacker has to try all 2^128
     possible tags one by one.  However, if the timing of the tag
     comparison operation reveals how long a prefix of the calculated and
     received tags is identical, the number of messages can be reduced
     significantly.  For this reason, with online protocols,
