          On broadcast networks and physical point-to-point networks,
          Hello packets are sent every HelloInterval seconds to the IP
          multicast address AllSPFRouters.  On virtual links, Hello
          packets are sent as unicasts (addressed directly to the other
          end of the virtual link) every HelloInterval seconds. On Point-
          to-MultiPoint networks, separate Hello packets are sent to each
          attached neighbor every HelloInterval seconds. Sending of Hello
          packets on NBMA networks is covered in the next section.
