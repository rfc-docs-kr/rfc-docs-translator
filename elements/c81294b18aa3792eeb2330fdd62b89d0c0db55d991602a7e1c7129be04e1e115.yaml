     There are so many small updates that changing versions became
     necessary to enable clarification and consistent behavior.  Anyone
     implementing RTSP for a new use case in which they have not installed
     RTSP 1.0 should only implement RTSP 2.0 to avoid having to deal with
     RTSP 1.0 inconsistencies.

  작은 업데이트가 너무 많아서 설명과 일관된 동작을 가능하게 하려면 버전을 변경해야 했습니다. RTSP 1.0을 설치하지 않은 새로운 사용 사례를 위해 RTSP를 구현하는 사람은 RTSP 1.0 불일치를 처리할 필요가 없도록 RTSP 2.0만 구현해야 합니다.
