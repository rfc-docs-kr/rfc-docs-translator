     For case (a), the modifications necessary to a routing protocol to
     allow it to support aggregated information may not be simple. For
     protocols such as OSPF and IS-IS, which represent routing information
     as either a destination+mask (OSPF) or as a prefix+prefix-length
     (IS-IS) changes to support aggregated information are conceptually
     fairly simple; for protocols which are dependent on the class-A/B/C
     nature of networks or which support only fixed-sized subnets, the
     changes are of a more fundamental nature. Even in the "conceptually
     simple" cases of OSPF and IS-IS, an implementation may need to be
     modified to support supernets in the database or in the forwarding
     table.
