     There's a wealth of earlier work on topology selection for simulation
     and performance evaluation of host-centric networks.  While the
     classic dumbbell topology is regarded as inappropriate for ICN, most
     ICN studies so far have been based on that earlier work for host-
     centric networks [RFC7476].  However, there is no single topology
     that can be used to easily evaluate all aspects of ICN.  Therefore,
     one should choose from a range of topologies depending on the focus
     of the evaluation.
