                   Generally, an interactive application protocol must set
                   the PUSH flag at least in the last SEND call in each
                   command or response sequence.  A bulk transfer protocol
                   like FTP should set the PUSH flag on the last segment
                   of a file or when necessary to prevent buffer deadlock.
