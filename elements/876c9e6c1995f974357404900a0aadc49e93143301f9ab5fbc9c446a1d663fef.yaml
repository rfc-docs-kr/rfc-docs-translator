        Note: In line with [RFC-2228], there is no facility for securing
        the Data connection with an insecure Control connection.
        Specifically, the PROT command MUST be preceded by a PBSZ command,
        and a PBSZ command MUST be preceded by a successful security data
        exchange (the TLS negotiation in this case).
