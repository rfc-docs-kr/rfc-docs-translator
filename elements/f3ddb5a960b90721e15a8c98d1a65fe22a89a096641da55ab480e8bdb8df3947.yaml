     Once the connection is established, the agent MUST utilize the shim
     defined in RFC 4571 [RFC4571] for the duration this connection
     remains open.  The STUN Binding requests and responses are sent on
     top of this shim, so that the length field defined in RFC 4571
     precedes each STUN message.  If TLS or DTLS-SRTP is to be utilized
     for the media session, the TLS or DTLS-SRTP handshakes will take
     place on top of this shim as well.  However, they only start once ICE
     processing has completed.  In essence, the TLS or DTLS-SRTP
     handshakes are considered a part of the media protocol.  STUN is
     never run within the TLS or DTLS-SRTP session as part of the ICE
     procedures.
