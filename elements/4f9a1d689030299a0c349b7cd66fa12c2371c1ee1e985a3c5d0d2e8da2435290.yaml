              Since RFC-793 was written, there has been extensive work on
              TCP algorithms to achieve efficient data communication.
              Later sections of the present document describe required and
              recommended TCP algorithms to determine when to send data
              (Section 4.2.3.4), when to send an acknowledgment (Section
              4.2.3.2), and when to update the window (Section 4.2.3.3).
