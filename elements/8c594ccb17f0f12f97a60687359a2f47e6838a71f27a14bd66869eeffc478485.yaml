          (f) If this new LSA indicates that it was originated by the
              receiving router itself (i.e., is considered a self-
              originated LSA), the router must take special action, either
              updating the LSA or in some cases flushing it from the
              routing domain. For a description of how self-originated
              LSAs are detected and subsequently handled, see Section
              13.4.
