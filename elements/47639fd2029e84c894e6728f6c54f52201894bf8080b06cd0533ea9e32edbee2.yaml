     The Poly1305 authenticator is designed to ensure that forged messages
     are rejected with a probability of 1-(n/(2^102)) for a 16n-byte
     message, even after sending 2^64 legitimate messages, so it is
     SUF-CMA (strong unforgeability against chosen-message attacks) in the
     terminology of [AE].
