          subjectPublicKeyInfo contains information about the public key
            being certified.  The information identifies the entity's
            public-key algorithm (and any associated parameters); examples
            of public-key algorithms include the rsaEncryption object
            identifier from PKCS #1 [1].  The information also includes a
            bit-string representation of the entity's public key.  For the
            public-key algorithm just mentioned, the bit string contains
            the DER encoding of a value of PKCS #1 type RSAPublicKey.  The
            values of type SubjectPublicKeyInfo{} allowed for
            subjectPKInfo are constrained to the values specified by the
            information object set PKInfoAlgorithms, which includes the
            extension marker (...).  Definitions of specific algorithm
            objects are left to specifications that reference this
            document.  Such specifications will be interoperable with
            their future versions if any additional algorithm objects are
            added after the extension marker.
