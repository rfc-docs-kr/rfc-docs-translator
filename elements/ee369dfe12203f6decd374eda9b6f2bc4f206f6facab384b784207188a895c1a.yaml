        Also, those locations which do a significant amount of business
        with XYZ Corporation could have a specific entry in their routing
        tables added to ensure optimal routing of packets to XYZ. For
        example, suppose that another commercial backbone
        "OldCommercialNet" has a large number of customers which exchange
        traffic with XYZ Corporation, and that this third TRD is directly
        connected to both NorthSouthNet and NewCommercialNet. In this case
        OldCommercialNet will continue to have a single entry in its
        routing tables for other traffic destined for NorthSouthNet, but
        may choose to add one additional (more specific) entry to ensure
        that packets sent to XYZ Corporation's old address are routed
        correctly.
