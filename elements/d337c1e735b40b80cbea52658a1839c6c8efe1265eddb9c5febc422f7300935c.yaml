     Most commands are for the specific use of the Media Gateway
     Controller as command initiator in controlling Media Gateways as
     command responders.  The exceptions are the Notify and ServiceChange
     commands: Notify is sent from Media Gateway to Media Gateway
     Controller, and ServiceChange may be sent by either entity.  Below is
     an overview of the commands; they are explained in more detail in
     section 7.2.
