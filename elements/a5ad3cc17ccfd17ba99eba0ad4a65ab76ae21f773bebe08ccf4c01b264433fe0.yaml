     [1] Support for bi-directional session key derivation in the lower
         layer.  Lower layers such as IEEE 802.11 may only support uni-
         directional derivation and transport of transient session keys.
         For example, the group-key handshake defined in [IEEE-802.11i] is
         uni-directional, since in IEEE 802.11 infrastructure mode, only
         the Access Point (AP) sends multicast/broadcast traffic.  In IEEE
         802.11 ad hoc mode, where either peer may send
         multicast/broadcast traffic, two uni-directional group-key
