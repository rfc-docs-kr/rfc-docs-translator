     If the receiver encounters an error such that it cannot determine a
     legal Action, it will return a TransactionReply consisting of the
     TransactionID and a single error descriptor, 422 Syntax Error in
     Action. If the end of an action cannot be reliably determined but one
     or more Actions can be parsed, it will process them and then send 422
     Syntax Error in Action as the last action for the transaction.  If
     the receiver encounters an error such that is cannot determine a
     legal Transaction, it will return a TransactionReply with a null
     TransactionID and a single error descriptor (403 Syntax Error in
     Transaction).
