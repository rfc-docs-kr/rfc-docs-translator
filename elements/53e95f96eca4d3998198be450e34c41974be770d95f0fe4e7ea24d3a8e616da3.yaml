     The possibility exists for Control-Client failure after TWAMP-
     Control connection establishment, or the path between the Control-
     Client and Server may fail while a connection is in progress.  The
     Server MAY discontinue any established control connection when no
     packet associated with that connection has been received within
     SERVWAIT seconds.  The Server SHALL suspend monitoring control
     connection activity after receiving a Start-Sessions command, and
     SHALL resume after receiving a Stop-Sessions command (IF the SERVWAIT
     option is supported).  Note that the REFWAIT timeout (described
     below) covers failures during test sessions, and if REFWAIT expires
     on ALL test sessions initiated by a TWAMP-Control connection, then
     the SERVWAIT monitoring SHALL resume (as though a Stop-Sessions
     command had been received).  An implementation that supports the
     SERVWAIT timeout SHOULD also implement the REFWAIT timeout.  The
     default value of SERVWAIT SHALL be 900 seconds, and this waiting time
     MAY be configurable.  This timeout allows the Server to free up
     resources in case of failure.
