     If the rendezvous protocol exchange is compromised, the shared secret
     can be learned by an attacker, and the attacker may be able to fake
     the connectivity check validation and open a TCP connection to the
     target.  Hence, using additional security mechanisms (e.g.,
     application-layer security) that mitigate these risks is RECOMMENDED.
