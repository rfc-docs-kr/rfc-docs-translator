     The DAVA message is sent from an SGP to all concerned ASPs to
     indicate that the SG has determined that one or more SS7 destinations
     are now reachable (and not restricted), or in response to a DAUD
     message, if appropriate.  If the ASP M3UA layer previously had no
     routes to the affected destinations, the ASP MTP3-User protocol is
     informed and may now resume traffic to the affected destination.  The
     ASP M3UA layer now routes the MTP3-user traffic through the SG
     initiating the DAVA message.
