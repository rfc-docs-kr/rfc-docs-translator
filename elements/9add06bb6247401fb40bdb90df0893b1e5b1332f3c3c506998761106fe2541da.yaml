     Many registries include designation of a technical or administrative
     contact associated with each entry.  Often, this is recorded as
     contact information for an individual.  It is unclear, though, what
     role the individual has with respect to the registration: is this
     item registered on behalf of the individual, the company the
     individual worked for, or perhaps another organization the individual
     was acting for?
