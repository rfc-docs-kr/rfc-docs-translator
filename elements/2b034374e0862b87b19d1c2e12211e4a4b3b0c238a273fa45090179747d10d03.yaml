        The conditional Routing Context parameter contains the Routing
        Context values associated with the DUNA message.  Where a Routing
        Key has not been coordinated between the SGP and ASP, sending of
        Routing Context is not required.  Where multiple Routing Keys and
        Routing Contexts are used across a common association, the Routing
        Context(s) MUST be sent to identify the concerned traffic flows
        for which the DUNA message applies, assisting in outgoing traffic
        management and internal distribution of MTP-PAUSE indications to
        MTP3-Users at the receiver.
