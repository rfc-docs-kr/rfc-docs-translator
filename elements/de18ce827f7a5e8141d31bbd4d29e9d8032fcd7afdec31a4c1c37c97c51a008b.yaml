              NBMA mode is the most efficient way to run OSPF over non-
              broadcast networks, both in terms of link-state database
              size and in terms of the amount of routing protocol traffic.
              However, it has one significant restriction: it requires all
              routers attached to the NBMA network to be able to
              communicate directly. This restriction may be met on some
              non-broadcast networks, such as an ATM subnet utilizing
              SVCs. But it is often not met on other non-broadcast
              networks, such as PVC-only Frame Relay networks. On non-
              broadcast networks where not all routers can communicate
              directly you can break the non-broadcast network into
              logical subnets, with the routers on each subnet being able
              to communicate directly, and then run each separate subnet
              as an NBMA network (see [Ref15]). This however requires
              quite a bit of administrative overhead, and is prone to
              misconfiguration. It is probably better to run such a non-
              broadcast network in Point-to-Multipoint mode.
