        Based on the fact that while servers may request TLS
        renegotiation, only clients may initiate it, this synchronization
        problem can be avoided by clients and servers as follows: server
        applications MUST NOT request TLS renegotiation during phases of
        the application protocol during which application-layer
        authentication occurs.  Client applications SHOULD NOT initiate
        TLS renegotiation between the start and completion of
        authentication.

  - 서버가 TLS 재협상을 요청할 수 있지만 클라이언트만이 이를 시작할 수 있다는 사실에 기초하여 클라이언트와 서버는 다음과 같이 이 동기화 문제를 피할 수 있습니다. 인증이 발생합니다. 클라이언트 애플리케이션은 인증 시작과 완료 사이에 TLS 재협상을 시작해서는 안 됩니다.
