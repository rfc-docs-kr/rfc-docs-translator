        The mechanics of this scenario are straightforward. Each direct
        provider is given a unique small set of IP address prefixes, from
        which its attached leaf routing domains can allocates slightly
        longer IP address prefixes.  For example assume that NIST is a
        leaf routing domain whose inter-domain link is via SURANet. If
        SURANet is assigned an unique IP address prefix <198.1.0.0
        255.255.0.0>, NIST could use a unique IP prefix of <198.1.0.0
        255.255.240.0>.
