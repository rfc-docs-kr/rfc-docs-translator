     Hdr Ext Len         8-bit unsigned integer.  Length of the Routing
                         header in 8-octet units, not including the first
                         8 octets.  Note that when Addresses[1..n] are
                         compressed (i.e., value of CmprI or CmprE is not
                         0), Hdr Ext Len does not equal twice the number
                         of Addresses.
