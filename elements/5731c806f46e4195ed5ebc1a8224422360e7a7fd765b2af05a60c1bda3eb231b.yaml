     Depending on the method and circumstances, result indications can be
     spoofable by an attacker.  A method is said to provide protected
     result indications if it supports result indications, as well as the
     "integrity protection" and "replay protection" claims.  A method
     supporting protected result indications MUST indicate which result
     indications are protected, and which are not.
