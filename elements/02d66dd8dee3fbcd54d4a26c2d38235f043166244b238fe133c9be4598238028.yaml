     A queue or scheduled set of queues (which is an input to a scheduler)
     may also be capable of acting as a non-work-conserving [MODEL]
     traffic shaper: this is done by defining a Maximum Service Rate
     leaky-bucket profile in order to limit the scheduler bandwidth
     available to that input.  This is represented by a rate, in
     diffServMaxRateAbsolute; the classical weight is the ratio between
     that rate and the interface speed, or perhaps the ratio between that
     rate and the sum of the configured rates for classes.  The rate may
     be represented by a relative value, as a fraction of the interface's
     current line rate, diffServMaxRateRelative.  This MIB presumes that
     shaping is something a scheduler does to its inputs, which it models
     as a queue with a maximum rate or a scheduler whose output has a
     maximum rate.
