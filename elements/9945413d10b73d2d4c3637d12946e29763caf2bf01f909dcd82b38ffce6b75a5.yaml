        (c)  TeletexString, BMPString, and UniversalString are included
             for backward compatibility, and SHOULD NOT be used for
             certificates for new subjects.  However, these types MAY be
             used in certificates where the name was previously
             established, including cases in which a new certificate is
             being issued to an existing subject or a certificate is being
             issued to a new subject where the attributes being encoded
             have been previously established in certificates issued to
             other subjects.  Certificate users SHOULD be prepared to
             receive certificates with these types.
