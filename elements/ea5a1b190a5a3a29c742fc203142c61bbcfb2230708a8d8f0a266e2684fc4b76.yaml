                           * Prepares transmission of outgoing messages.
                             It picks up text messages from shared pages
                             (the messages are stored there by users),
                             formats them (adds leader, marking,
                             checksum..), and passes them along to the
                             Handler for transmission.
                           * Insures delivery of incoming messages.  It is
                             the opposite of the above operation.  The
                             users to which the messages should be
                             delivered are identified through the leaders.
