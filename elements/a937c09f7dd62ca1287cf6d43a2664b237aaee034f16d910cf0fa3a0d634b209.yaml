        The optional Concerned Destination parameter is only used if the
        SCON message is sent from an ASP to the SGP.  It contains the
        point code of the originator of the message that triggered the
        SCON message.  The Concerned Destination parameter contains one
        Concerned Destination Point Code field, a three-octet parameter to
        allow for 14-, 16-, and 24-bit binary formatted SS7 Point Codes.
        A Concerned Point Code that is less than 24 bits is padded on the
        left to the 24-bit boundary.  Any resulting Transfer Controlled
        (TFC) message from the SG is sent to the Concerned Point Code
        using the single Affected DPC contained in the SCON message to
        populate the (affected) Destination field of the TFC message
