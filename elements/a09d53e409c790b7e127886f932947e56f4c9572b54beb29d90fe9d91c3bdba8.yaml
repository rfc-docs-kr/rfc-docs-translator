     Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) protocols such as
     TACACS [RFC1492] and RADIUS [RFC2865] were initially deployed to
     provide dial-up PPP [RFC1661] and terminal server access.  Over time,
     AAA support was needed on many new access technologies, the scale and
     complexity of AAA networks grew, and AAA was also used on new
     applications (such as voice over IP).  This led to new demands on AAA
     protocols.
