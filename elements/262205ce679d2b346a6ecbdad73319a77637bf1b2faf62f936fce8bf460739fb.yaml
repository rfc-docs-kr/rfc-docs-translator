     NAPT extends the notion of translation one step further by also
     translating transport identifier (e.g., TCP and UDP port numbers,
     ICMP query identifiers). This allows the transport identifiers of a
     number of private hosts to be multiplexed into the transport
     identifiers of a single external address. NAPT allows a set of hosts
     to share a single external address. Note that NAPT can be combined
     with Basic NAT so that a pool of external addresses are used in
     conjunction with port translation.
