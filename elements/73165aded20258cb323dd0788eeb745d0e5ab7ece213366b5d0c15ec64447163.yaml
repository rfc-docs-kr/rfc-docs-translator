     The data model used in the XPath expression is the same as that used
     in XPath 1.0 [W3C.REC-xpath-19991116], with the same extension for
     root node children as used by XSLT 1.0 ([W3C.REC-xslt-19991116],
     Section 3.1).  Specifically, it means that the root node MAY have any
     number of element nodes as its children.
