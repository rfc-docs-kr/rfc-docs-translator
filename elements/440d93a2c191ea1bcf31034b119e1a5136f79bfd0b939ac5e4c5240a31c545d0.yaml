     A possible approach to avoid leaking of DNS RRs is to run two
     nameservers, one external server authoritative for all globally
     unique IP addresses of the enterprise and one internal nameserver
     authoritative for all IP addresses of the enterprise, both public and
     private.  In order to ensure consistency both these servers should be
     configured from the same data of which the external nameserver only
     receives a filtered version.
