     22. The MGC now sends both MGs a Subtract to take down the call. Only
     the subtracts to MG2 are shown here. Each termination has its own set
     of statistics that it gathers. An MGC may not need to request both to
     be returned. A5555 is a physical termination, and A5556 is an RTP
     termination.
