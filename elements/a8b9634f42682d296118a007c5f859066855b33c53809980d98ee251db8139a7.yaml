        |  Note: The rationale for treating the client as unvalidated
        |  rather than discarding the packet is that the client might have
        |  received the token in a previous connection using the NEW_TOKEN
        |  frame, and if the server has lost state, it might be unable to
        |  validate the token at all, leading to connection failure if the
        |  packet is discarded.
