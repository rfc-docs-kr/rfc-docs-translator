     The STARTTLS mechanism on port 587 is relatively widely deployed due
     to the situation with port 465 (discussed in Section 7.3).  This
     differs from IMAP and POP services where Implicit TLS is more widely
     deployed on servers than STARTTLS.  It is desirable to migrate core
     protocols used by MUA software to Implicit TLS over time, for
     consistency as well as for the additional reasons discussed in
     Appendix A.  However, to maximize the use of encryption for
     submission, it is desirable to support both mechanisms for Message
     Submission over TLS for a transition period of several years.  As a
     result, clients and servers SHOULD implement both STARTTLS on
     port 587 and Implicit TLS on port 465 for this transition period.
     Note that there is no significant difference between the security
     properties of STARTTLS on port 587 and Implicit TLS on port 465 if
     the implementations are correct and if both the client and the server
     are configured to require successful negotiation of TLS prior to
     Message Submission.
