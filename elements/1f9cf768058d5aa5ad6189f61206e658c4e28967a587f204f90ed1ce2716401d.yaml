     The Differentiated Services Architecture does not specify how an
     implementation should be assembled.  The [MODEL] describes a general
     approach to implementation design, or to user interface design.  Its
     components could, however, be assembled in a different way.  For
     example, traffic conforming to a meter might be run through a second
     meter, or reclassified.
