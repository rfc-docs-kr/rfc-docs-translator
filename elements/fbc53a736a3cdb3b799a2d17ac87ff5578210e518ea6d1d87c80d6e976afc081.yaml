          This section explains the detailed processing of a received
          Database Description Packet.  The incoming Database Description
          Packet has already been associated with a neighbor and receiving
          interface by the generic input packet processing (Section 8.2).
          Whether the Database Description packet should be accepted, and
          if so, how it should be further processed depends upon the
          neighbor state.
