        In order for data abstraction to be possible, the assignment of IP
        addresses must be accomplished in a manner which is consistent
        with the actual physical topology of the Internet. For example, in
        those cases where organizational and administrative boundaries are
        not related to actual network topology, address assignment based
        on such organization boundaries is not recommended.
