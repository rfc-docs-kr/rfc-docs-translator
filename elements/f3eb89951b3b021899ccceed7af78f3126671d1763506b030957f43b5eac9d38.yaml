     Traffic that exceeded the policy, however, is dropped.  A count
     action can be used on this traffic if the several counters are
     interesting.  However, since the drop counter in the Algorithmic Drop
     Entry will count packets dropped, this is not clearly necessary.  An
     Algorithmic Drop Entry of the type "alwaysDrop" with no successor is
     sufficient.
