          The state of a neighbor (really, the state of a conversation
          being held with a neighboring router) is documented in the
          following sections.  The states are listed in order of
          progressing functionality.  For example, the inoperative state
          is listed first, followed by a list of intermediate states
          before the final, fully functional state is achieved.  The
          specification makes use of this ordering by sometimes making
          references such as "those neighbors/adjacencies in state greater
          than X".  Figures 12 and 13 show the graph of neighbor state
          changes.  The arcs of the graphs are labelled with the event
          causing the state change.  The neighbor events are documented in
          Section 10.2.
