     Diameter nodes using TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP for security MUST mutually
     authenticate as part of TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP session establishment.
     In order to ensure mutual authentication, the Diameter node acting as
     the TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP server MUST request a certificate from the
     Diameter node acting as TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP client, and the
     Diameter node acting as the TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP client MUST be
     prepared to supply a certificate on request.
