     In practice, the work on security in the various ICN research
     projects has been heavily concentrated on authentication of content.
     Work on authorization, access control, and privacy and security
     threats due to the expanded role of in-network caches has been quite
     limited.  For example, a roadmap for improving the security model in
     NetInf can be found in [Renault09].  As secure communications on the
     Internet are becoming the norm, major gaps in ICN security aspects
     are bound to undermine the adoption of ICN.  A comprehensive overview
     of ICN security is also provided in [Tourani16].
