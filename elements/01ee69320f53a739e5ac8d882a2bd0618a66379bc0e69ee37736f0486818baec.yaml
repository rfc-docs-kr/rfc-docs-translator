      LSRefreshTime
          The maximum time between distinct originations of any particular
          LSA.  If the LS age field of one of the router's self-originated
          LSAs reaches the value LSRefreshTime, a new instance of the LSA
          is originated, even though the contents of the LSA (apart from
          the LSA header) will be the same.  The value of LSRefreshTime is
          set to 30 minutes.
