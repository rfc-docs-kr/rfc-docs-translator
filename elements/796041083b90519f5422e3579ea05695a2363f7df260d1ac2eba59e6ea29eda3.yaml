     Different environments may well allow different rights prior to and
     then after authentication.  Thus, an authorization model is not
     specified in this document.  When an operation is not properly
     authorized, a simple "access denied" is sufficient.  Note that
     authorization information can be exchanged in the form of
     configuration information, which is all the more reason to ensure the
     security of the connection.
