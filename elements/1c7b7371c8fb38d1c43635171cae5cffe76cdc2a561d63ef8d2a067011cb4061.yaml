          HelloInterval
              The length of time, in seconds, between the Hello Packets
              that the router sends on the interface.  This value is
              advertised in the router's Hello Packets.  It must be the
              same for all routers attached to a common network.  The
              smaller the HelloInterval, the faster topological changes
              will be detected; however, more OSPF routing protocol
              traffic will ensue.  Sample value for a X.25 PDN network: 30
              seconds.  Sample value for a local area network: 10 seconds.
