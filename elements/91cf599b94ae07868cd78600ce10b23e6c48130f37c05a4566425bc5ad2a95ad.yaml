        In general, it will not be practical to transition the IP
        addresses assigned to a routing domain in an instantaneous "change
        the address at midnight" manner. Instead, a gradual transition is
        required in which both the old and the new addresses will remain
        valid for a limited period of time. During the transition period,
        both the old and new addresses are accepted by the end systems in
        the routing domain, and both old and new addresses must result in
        correct routing of packets to the destination.
