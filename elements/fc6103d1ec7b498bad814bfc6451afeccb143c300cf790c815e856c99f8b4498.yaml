     Multiplexing of requests is achieved by having each HTTP request/
     response exchange associated with its own stream (Section 5).
     Streams are largely independent of each other, so a blocked or
     stalled request or response does not prevent progress on other
     streams.

  요청의 다중화는 각 HTTP 요청/응답 교환을 자체 스트림과 연결함으로써 달성됩니다(섹션 5). 스트림은 대체로 서로 독립적이므로 차단되거나 중단된 요청이나 응답이 다른 스트림의 진행을 방해하지 않습니다.
