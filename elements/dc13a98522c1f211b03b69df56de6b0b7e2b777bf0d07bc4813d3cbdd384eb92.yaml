     Implementers should be aware that the use of client certificates with
     TLS 1.2 reveals the user's identity to any party with the ability to
     read packets from the transmission medium and therefore may
     compromise the user's privacy.  There seems to be no easy fix with
     TLS 1.2 or earlier versions, other than to avoid presenting client
     certificates except when there is explicit authorization to do so.
     TLS 1.3 [TLS-1.3] appears to reduce this privacy risk somewhat.
