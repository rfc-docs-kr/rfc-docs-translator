          If there is no matching routing table entry, or the best match
          routing table entry is one of the above "discard" routing table
          entries, then the packet's IP destination is considered
          unreachable. Instead of being forwarded, the packet should then
          be discarded and an ICMP destination unreachable message should
          be returned to the packet's source.
