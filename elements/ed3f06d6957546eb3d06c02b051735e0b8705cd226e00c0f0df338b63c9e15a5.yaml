        (e)  inhibit_anyPolicy:  an integer that indicates whether the
             anyPolicy policy identifier is considered a match.  The
             integer indicates the number of non-self-issued certificates
             to be processed before the anyPolicy OID, if asserted in a
             certificate other than an intermediate self-issued
             certificate, is ignored.  Once set, this variable may be
             decreased, but may not be increased.  That is, if a
             certificate in the path inhibits processing of anyPolicy, a
             later certificate cannot permit it.  If initial-any-policy-
             inhibit is set, then the initial value is 0, otherwise the
             initial value is n+1.
