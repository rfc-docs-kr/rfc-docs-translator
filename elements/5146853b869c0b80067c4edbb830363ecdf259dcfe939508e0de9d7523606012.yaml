        6.  RFC 2617 [17] requires that a server check that the URI in the
            request line and the URI included in the Authorization header
            field point to the same resource.  In a SIP context, these two
            URIs may refer to different users, due to forwarding at some
            proxy.  Therefore, in SIP, a server MAY check that the
            Request-URI in the Authorization header field value
            corresponds to a user for whom the server is willing to accept
            forwarded or direct requests, but it is not necessarily a
            failure if the two fields are not equivalent.
