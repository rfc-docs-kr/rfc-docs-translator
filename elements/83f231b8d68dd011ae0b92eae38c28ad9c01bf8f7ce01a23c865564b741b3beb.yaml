        o    RFC-792 [IP:2] defines ICMP, which provides routing,
             diagnostic and error functionality for IP.  Although ICMP
             messages are encapsulated within IP datagrams, ICMP
             processing is considered to be (and is typically implemented
             as) part of the IP layer.  See Section 3.2.2.
