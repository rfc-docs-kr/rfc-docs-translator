     - If an SGP suffers a partial failure (where an SGP can continue to
       service one or more active AS but due to a partial failure it is
       unable to service one or more other active AS), the SGP should send
       ASP Inactive Ack to all its connected ASPs for the affected AS.
       Upon receiving an ASP Active message for an affected AS while still
       partially isolated from the NIF, the SGP should respond with an
       Error ("Refused - Management Blocking").
