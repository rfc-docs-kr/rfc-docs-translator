              If the entry indicates that the area border router is newly
              reachable, the corresponding virtual link is now
              operational.  An InterfaceUp event should be generated for
              the virtual link, which will cause a virtual adjacency to
              begin to form (see Section 10.3).  At this time the virtual
              link's IP interface address and the virtual neighbor's
              Neighbor IP address are also calculated.
