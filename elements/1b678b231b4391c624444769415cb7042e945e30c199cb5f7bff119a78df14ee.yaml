     This example scenario illustrates the use of the elements of the
     protocol to set up a Residential Gateway to Residential Gateway call
     over an IP-based network.  For simplicity, this example assumes that
     both Residential Gateways involved in the call are controlled by the
     same Media Gateway Controller.
