     Both client and server implementations MUST make the certificate
     fingerprints for their certificate available through a management
     interface.  The labels for the algorithms are taken from the textual
     names of the hash functions as defined in the IANA registry "Hash
     Function Textual Names" allocated in [RFC4572].
