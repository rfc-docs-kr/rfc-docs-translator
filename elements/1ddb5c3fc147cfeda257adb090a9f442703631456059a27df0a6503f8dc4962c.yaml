     Packet Padding in TWAMP-Test SHOULD be pseudo-random (it MUST be
     generated independently of any other pseudo-random numbers mentioned
     in this document).  However, implementations MUST provide a
     configuration parameter, an option, or a different means of making
     Packet Padding consist of all zeros.  Packet Padding MUST NOT be
     covered by the HMAC and MUST NOT be encrypted.
