     During a PAUSE/PLAY interaction in an RTSP session, the duration of
     time for which the RTP transmission was halted MUST be reflected in
     the RTP timestamp of each RTP stream.  The duration can be calculated
     for each RTP stream as the time elapsed from when the last RTP packet
     was sent before the PAUSE request was received and when the first RTP
     packet was sent after the subsequent PLAY request was received.  The
     duration includes all latency incurred and processing time required
     to complete the request.

  RTSP 세션에서 PAUSE/PLAY 상호 작용 중에 RTP 전송이 중단된 기간은 각 RTP 스트림의 RTP 타임스탬프에 반영되어야 합니다. PAUSE 요청이 수신되기 전 마지막 RTP 패킷이 전송된 시점과 후속 PLAY 요청이 수신된 후 첫 번째 RTP 패킷이 전송된 시점부터 경과된 시간으로 각 RTP 스트림에 대해 지속 시간을 계산할 수 있습니다. 기간에는 발생한 모든 지연 시간과 요청을 완료하는 데 필요한 처리 시간이 포함됩니다.
