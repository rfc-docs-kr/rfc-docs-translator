                This scheme, using extra trailer ARP reply packets rather
                than sending an ARP request for the trailer protocol type,
                was designed to avoid a continuous exchange of ARP packets
                with a misbehaving host that, contrary to any
                specification or common sense, responded to an ARP reply
                for trailers with another ARP reply for IP.  This problem
                is avoided by sending a trailer ARP reply in response to
                an IP ARP reply only when the IP ARP reply answers an
                outstanding request; this is true when the hardware
                address for the host is still unknown when the IP ARP
                reply is received.  A trailer ARP reply may always be sent
                along with an IP ARP reply responding to an IP ARP
                request.
