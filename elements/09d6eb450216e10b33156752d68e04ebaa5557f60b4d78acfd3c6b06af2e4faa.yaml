     [2] Lower layer error detection.  While EAP does not assume that the
         lower layer is reliable, it does rely on lower layer error
         detection (e.g., CRC, Checksum, MIC, etc.).  EAP methods may not
         include a MIC, or if they do, it may not be computed over all the
         fields in the EAP packet, such as the Code, Identifier, Length,
         or Type fields.  As a result, without lower layer error
         detection, undetected errors could creep into the EAP layer or
         EAP method layer header fields, resulting in authentication
         failures.
