     One goal of NETCONF is to provide a programmatic interface to the
     device that closely follows the functionality of the device's native
     interface.  Therefore, it is expected that the underlying protocol
     uses existing authentication mechanisms available on the device.  For
     example, a NETCONF server on a device that supports RADIUS [RFC2865]
     might allow the use of RADIUS to authenticate NETCONF sessions.
