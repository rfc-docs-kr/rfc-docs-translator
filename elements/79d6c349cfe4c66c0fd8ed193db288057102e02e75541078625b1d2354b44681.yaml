        Real-time accounting involves the processing of information on
        resource usage within a defined time window.  Typically, time
        constraints are imposed in order to limit financial risk.  The
        Diameter Credit-Control Application [RFC4006] is an example of an
        application that defines real-time accounting functionality.
