        The AVP with Value field set to DELIVER_AND_GRANT means that the
        service MUST only be granted as long as there is a connection to
        an accounting server.  Note that the set of alternative accounting
        servers are treated as one server in this sense.  Having to move
        the accounting record stream to a backup server is not a reason to
        discontinue the service to the user.
