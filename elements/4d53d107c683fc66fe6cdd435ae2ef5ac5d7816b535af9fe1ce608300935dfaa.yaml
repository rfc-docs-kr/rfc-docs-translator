     The following is a description of the properties of realms supported
     by traditional NAT. IP addresses of hosts in external network are
     unique and valid in external as well as private networks. However,
     the addresses of hosts in private network are unique only within the
     private network and may not be valid in the external network. In
     other words, NAT would not advertise private networks to the external
     realm. But, networks from the external realm may be advertised within
     the private network.  The addresses used within private network must
     not overlap with the external addresses. Any given address must
     either be a private address or an external address; not both.
