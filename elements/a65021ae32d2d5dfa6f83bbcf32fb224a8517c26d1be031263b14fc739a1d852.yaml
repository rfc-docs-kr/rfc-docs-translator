              A TCP MUST inform the application layer asynchronously
              whenever it receives an Urgent pointer and there was
              previously no pending urgent data, or whenever the Urgent
              pointer advances in the data stream.  There MUST be a way
              for the application to learn how much urgent data remains to
              be read from the connection, or at least to determine
              whether or not more urgent data remains to be read.
