     The following is a discussion of routing alternatives that may be
     pursued for the end-to-end RSA-IP packets within private realm.  One
     approach would be to tunnel the packet to the destination. The outer
     header can be translated by NAT as normal without affecting the
     addresses used in the internal header. Another approach would be to

     border router straddling the two address realms. Packets to and from
     the client would be tunneled, but packets would be forwarded as
