     The Class AVP (AVP Code 25) is of type OctetString and is used by
     Diameter servers to return state information to the access device.
     When one or more Class AVPs are present in application-specific
     authorization answer messages, they MUST be present in subsequent re-
     authorization, session termination and accounting messages.  Class
     AVPs found in a re-authorization answer message override the ones
     found in any previous authorization answer message.  Diameter server
     implementations SHOULD NOT return Class AVPs that require more than
     4096 bytes of storage on the Diameter client.  A Diameter client that
     receives Class AVPs whose size exceeds local available storage MUST
     terminate the session.
