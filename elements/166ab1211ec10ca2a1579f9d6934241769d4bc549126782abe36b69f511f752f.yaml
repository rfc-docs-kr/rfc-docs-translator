     Another possible direction of abstraction is one using a concept of
     "roles" (often, but not always, applied to interfaces).  In this
     case, it may be possible to re-use the object definitions in this
     MIB, especially the parameterization tables.  The Data Path table
     will help in the reuse of the data path linkage tables by having the
     interface specific information centralized, allowing easier
     mechanical replacement of ifIndex by some sort of "roleIndex".  This
     work is ongoing.
