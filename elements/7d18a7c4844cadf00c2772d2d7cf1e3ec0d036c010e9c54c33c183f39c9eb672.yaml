     Traffic mapping is the assignment of traffic workload onto (pre-
     established) paths to meet certain requirements.  Thus, while
     constraint-based routing deals with path selection, traffic mapping
     deals with the assignment of traffic to established paths that may
     have been generated by constraint-based routing or by some other
     means.  Traffic mapping can be performed by time-dependent or state-
     dependent mechanisms, as described in Section 4.1.

  트래픽 매핑은 특정 요구 사항을 충족하기 위해 (사전 설정된) 경로에 트래픽 워크로드를 할당하는 것입니다. 따라서 제약 기반 라우팅이 경로 선택을 다루는 반면, 트래픽 매핑은 제약 기반 라우팅이나 다른 수단에 의해 생성되었을 수 있는 설정된 경로에 대한 트래픽 할당을 다룹니다. 트래픽 매핑은 섹션 4.1에 설명된 대로 시간 종속적 또는 상태 종속적 메커니즘으로 수행될 수 있습니다.
