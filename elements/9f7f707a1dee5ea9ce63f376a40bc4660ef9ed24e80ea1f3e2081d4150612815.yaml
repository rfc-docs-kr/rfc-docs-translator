     If a connection has been selected by ICE, an agent MAY close it
     anyway.  As described in the next paragraph, this will cause it to be
     reopened almost immediately, and in the interim, media cannot be
     sent.  Consequently, such closures have a negative effect and are NOT
     RECOMMENDED.  However, there may be cases where an agent needs to
     close a connection for some reason.
