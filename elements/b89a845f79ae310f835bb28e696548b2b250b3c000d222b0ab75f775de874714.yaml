     As an interim solution, an optional AH header is defined within the
     H.248 protocol header. The header fields are exactly those of the
     SPI, SEQUENCE NUMBER and DATA fields as defined in [RFC2402]. The
     semantics of the header fields are the same as the "transport mode"
     of [RFC2402], except for the calculation of the Integrity Check value
     (ICV). In IPsec, the ICV is calculated over the entire IP packet
     including the IP header. This prevents spoofing of the IP addresses.
     To retain the same functionality, the ICV calculation should be
     performed across the entire transaction prepended by a synthesized IP
     header consisting of a 32 bit source IP address, a 32 bit destination
     address and a 16 bit UDP destination port encoded as 10 hex digits.
     When the interim AH mechanism is employed when TCP is the transport
     Layer, the UDP Port above becomes the TCP port, and all other
     operations are the same.
