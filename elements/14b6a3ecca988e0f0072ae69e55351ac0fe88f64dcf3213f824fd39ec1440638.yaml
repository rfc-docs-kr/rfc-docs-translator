     Although EAP supports peer-to-peer operation, some EAP
     implementations, methods, AAA protocols, and link layers may not
     support this.  Some EAP methods may support asymmetric
     authentication, with one type of credential being required for the
     peer and another type for the authenticator.  Hosts supporting peer-
     to-peer operation with such a method would need to be provisioned
     with both types of credentials.
