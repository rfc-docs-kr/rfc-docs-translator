              looped back.  The interface may be looped back in hardware
              or software.  The interface will be unavailable for regular
              data traffic.  However, it may still be desirable to gain
              information on the quality of this interface, either through
              sending ICMP pings to the interface or through something
              like a bit error test.  For this reason, IP packets may
              still be addressed to an interface in Loopback state.  To
