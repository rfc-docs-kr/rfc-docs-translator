        It is RECOMMENDED that the Identity Response be used primarily for
        routing purposes and selecting which EAP method to use.  EAP
        Methods SHOULD include a method-specific mechanism for obtaining
        the identity, so that they do not have to rely on the Identity
        Response.  Identity Requests and Responses are sent in cleartext,
        so an attacker may snoop on the identity, or even modify or spoof
        identity exchanges.  To address these threats, it is preferable
        for an EAP method to include an identity exchange that supports
        per-packet authentication, integrity and replay protection, and
        confidentiality.  The Identity Response may not be the appropriate
        identity for the method; it may have been truncated or obfuscated
        so as to provide privacy, or it may have been decorated for
        routing purposes.  Where the peer is configured to only accept
        authentication methods supporting protected identity exchanges,
        the peer MAY provide an abbreviated Identity Response (such as
        omitting the peer-name portion of the NAI [RFC2486]).  For further
        discussion of identity protection, see Section 7.3.
