     The SGP M3UA layer determines the set of concerned ASPs to be
     informed based on the specific SS7 network for which the primitive
     indication is relevant.  In this way, all ASPs configured to
     send/receive traffic within a particular Network Appearance are
     informed.  If the SGP operates within a single SS7 Network
     Appearance, then all ASPs are informed.
