           Adaptability to change must be designed into all levels of
           Internet host software.  As a simple example, consider a
           protocol specification that contains an enumeration of values
           for a particular header field -- e.g., a type field, a port
           number, or an error code; this enumeration must be assumed to
           be incomplete.  Thus, if a protocol specification defines four
           possible error codes, the software must not break when a fifth
           code shows up.  An undefined code might be logged (see below),
           but it must not cause a failure.
