     The MIB also allows for ambiguous classification in a structured
     fashion.  In the end, traffic classification must be unambiguous; one
     must know for certain what policy to apply to any given packet.
     However, writing an unambiguous specification is often tedious, while
     writing a specification in steps that permits and excludes various
     kinds of traffic may be simpler and more intuitive.  In such a case,
     the classification "steps" are enumerated; all classification
     elements of one precedence are applied as if in parallel, and then
     all classification elements of the next precedence.
