  -- An entry of diffServQTable represents a FIFO queue Differentiated
  -- Services Functional Data Path element as described in the Informal
  -- Differentiated Services Model section 7.1.1. Note that the
  -- specification of scheduling parameters for a queue as part of the
  -- input to a scheduler functional data path element as described in
  -- the Informal Differentiated Services Model section 7.1.2. This
  -- allows building of hierarchical queuing/scheduling. A queue
  -- therefore has these attributes:
  --
  -- 1. Which scheduler will service this queue, diffServQNext.
  -- 2. How the scheduler will service this queue, with respect
  --    to all the other queues the same scheduler needs to service,
  --    diffServQMinRate.
  --
  -- Note that upstream Differentiated Services Functional Data Path
  -- elements may point to a shared diffServQTable entry as described
  -- in the Informal Differentiated Services Model section 7.1.1.
