     In some cases, the Diameter accounting server can delay the duplicate
     detection and accounting record processing until a post-processing
     phase takes place.  At that time records are likely to be sorted
     according to the included User-Name and duplicate elimination is easy
     in this case.  In other situations, it may be necessary to perform
     real-time duplicate detection, such as when credit limits are imposed
     or real-time fraud detection is desired.
