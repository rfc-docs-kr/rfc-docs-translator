     It is worth noting that the use of MPLS makes it much simpler to
     provide this level of security than would be possible if one
     attempted to use some form of IP-within-IP tunneling in place of
     MPLS.  It is a simple matter to refuse to accept a labeled packet
     unless the first of the above conditions applies to it.  It is rather
     more difficult to configure the a router to refuse to accept an IP
     packet if that packet is an IP-within-IP tunnelled packet which is
     going to a "wrong" place.

  MPLS를 사용하면 MPLS 대신 IP 내 IP 터널링을 사용하려고 시도하는 경우보다 이 수준의 보안을 제공하는 것이 훨씬 간단해진다는 점에 주목할 가치가 있습니다. 위의 조건 중 첫 번째 조건이 적용되지 않는 한 레이블이 지정된 패킷을 수락하지 않는 것은 간단한 문제입니다. 해당 패킷이 "잘못된" 위치로 가는 IP 내 IP 터널링 패킷인 경우 라우터가 IP 패킷을 수락하지 않도록 구성하는 것은 훨씬 더 어렵습니다.
