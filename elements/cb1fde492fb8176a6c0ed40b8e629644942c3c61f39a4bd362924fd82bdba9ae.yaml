     ALGs may not always utilize NAT state information. They may glean
     application payload and simply notify NAT to add additional state
     information in some cases. ALGs are similar to Proxies, in that, both
     ALGs and proxies facilitate Application specific communication
     between clients and servers. Proxies use a special protocol to
     communicate with proxy clients and relay client data to servers and
     vice versa. Unlike Proxies, ALGs do not use a special protocol to
     communicate with application clients and do not require changes to
     application clients.
