     Note: This section and a few others contain pseudocode for the
     algorithm explained in a previous section.  Every effort was made for
     the pseudocode to accurately reflect the algorithm as described in
     the preceding section.  If a conflict is still present, the textual
     explanation and the test vectors are normative.
