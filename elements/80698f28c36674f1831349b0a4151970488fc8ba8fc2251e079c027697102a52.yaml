     In the case where successful authentication is sufficient to
     authorize access, then the peer and authenticator will also know if
     the other party is willing to provide or accept access.  This may not
     always be the case.  An authenticated peer may be denied access due
     to lack of authorization (e.g., session limit) or other reasons.
     Since the EAP exchange is run between the peer and the server, other
     nodes (such as AAA proxies) may also affect the authorization
     decision.  This is discussed in more detail in Section 7.16.
