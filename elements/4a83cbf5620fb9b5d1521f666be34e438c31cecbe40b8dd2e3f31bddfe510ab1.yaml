     If the MG detects a failure of its controlling MGC, it attempts to
     contact the next MGC on its pre-provisioned list.  It starts its
     attempts at the beginning (Primary MGC), unless that was the MGC that
     failed, in which case it starts at its first Secondary MGC.  It sends
     a ServiceChange message with a "Failover" method and a " MGC
     Impending Failure" reason.
