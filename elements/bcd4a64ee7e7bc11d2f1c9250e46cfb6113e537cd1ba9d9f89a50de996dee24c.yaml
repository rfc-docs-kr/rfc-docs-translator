          When whatever is being described by an LSA changes, a new LSA is
          originated.  However, two instances of the same LSA may not be
          originated within the time period MinLSInterval.  This may
          require that the generation of the next instance be delayed by
          up to MinLSInterval.  The following events may cause the
          contents of an LSA to change.  These events should cause new
          originations if and only if the contents of the new LSA would be
          different:
