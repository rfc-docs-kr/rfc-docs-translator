     In EAP there is no provision for retries of failed authentication.
     However, in PPP the LCP state machine can renegotiate the
     authentication protocol at any time, thus allowing a new attempt.
     Similarly, in IEEE 802.1X the Supplicant or Authenticator can re-
     authenticate at any time.  It is recommended that any counters used
     for authentication failure not be reset until after successful
     authentication, or subsequent termination of the failed link.
