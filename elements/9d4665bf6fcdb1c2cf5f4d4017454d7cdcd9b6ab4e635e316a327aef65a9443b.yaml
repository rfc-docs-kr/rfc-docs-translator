          Direct acknowledgments are sent directly to a particular
          neighbor in response to the receipt of duplicate LSAs. Direct
          acknowledgments are sent immediately when the duplicate is
          received. On multi-access networks, these acknowledgments are
          sent directly to the neighbor's IP address.
