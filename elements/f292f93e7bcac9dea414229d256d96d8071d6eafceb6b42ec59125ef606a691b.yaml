     The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be
     created or replaced with the state defined by the representation
     enclosed in the request message content.  A successful PUT of a given
     representation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same
     target resource will result in an equivalent representation being
     sent in a 200 (OK) response.  However, there is no guarantee that
     such a state change will be observable, since the target resource
     might be acted upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be
     subject to dynamic processing by the origin server, before any
     subsequent GET is received.  A successful response only implies that
     the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its processing by
     the origin server.

  PUT 메서드는 대상 리소스의 상태가 생성되거나 요청 메시지 내용에 포함된 표현으로 정의된 상태로 대체되도록 요청합니다. 주어진 표현의 성공적인 PUT은 동일한 대상 리소스에 대한 후속 GET이 200(OK) 응답으로 전송되는 동등한 표현을 초래할 것임을 제안합니다. 그러나 후속 GET이 수신되기 전에 대상 리소스가 다른 사용자 에이전트에 의해 병렬로 작동되거나 원본 서버에 의해 동적 처리될 수 있으므로 이러한 상태 변경이 관찰 가능하다는 보장은 없습니다. 성공적인 응답은 원서버가 처리할 때 사용자 에이전트의 의도가 달성되었음을 의미합니다.
