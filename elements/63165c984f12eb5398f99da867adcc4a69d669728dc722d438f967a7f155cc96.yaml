         It would point another diffServSchedulerEntry when implementing
         multiple scheduler methods for the same data path, such as having
         one set of queues scheduled by WRR and that group participating
         in a priority scheduling system in which other queues compete
         with it in that way.  It might also point to a second scheduler
         in a hierarchical scheduling system.
