           The second part of the principle is almost as important:
           software on other hosts may contain deficiencies that make it
           unwise to exploit legal but obscure protocol features.  It is
           unwise to stray far from the obvious and simple, lest untoward
           effects result elsewhere.  A corollary of this is "watch out
           for misbehaving hosts"; host software should be prepared, not
           just to survive other misbehaving hosts, but also to cooperate
           to limit the amount of disruption such hosts can cause to the
           shared communication facility.
