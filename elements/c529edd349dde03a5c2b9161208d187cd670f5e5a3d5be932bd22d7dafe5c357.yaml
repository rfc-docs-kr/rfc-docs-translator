          Including the mask with each advertised destination enables the
          implementation of what is commonly referred to as variable-
          length subnetting.  This means that a single IP class A, B, or C
          network number can be broken up into many subnets of various
          sizes.  For example, the network 128.185.0.0 could be broken up
          into 62 variable-sized subnets: 15 subnets of size 4K, 15
          subnets of size 256, and 32 subnets of size 8.  Table 7 shows
          some of the resulting network addresses together with their
          masks.
