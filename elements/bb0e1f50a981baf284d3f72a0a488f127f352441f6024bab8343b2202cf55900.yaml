     Basic Synthesizer
                    A speech synthesizer resource that has very limited
                    capabilities and can generate its media stream
                    exclusively from concatenated audio clips.  The speech
                    data is described using a limited subset of the Speech
                    Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)
                    [W3C.REC-speech-synthesis-20040907] elements.  A basic
                    synthesizer MUST support the SSML tags <speak>,
                    <audio>, <say-as>, and <mark>.
