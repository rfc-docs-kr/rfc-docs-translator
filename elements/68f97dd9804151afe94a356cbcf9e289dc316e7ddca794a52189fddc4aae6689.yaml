      This document is a specification of the Open Shortest Path First
      (OSPF) TCP/IP internet routing protocol.  OSPF is classified as an
      Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP).  This means that it distributes
      routing information between routers belonging to a single Autonomous
      System.  The OSPF protocol is based on link-state or SPF technology.
      This is a departure from the Bellman-Ford base used by traditional
      TCP/IP internet routing protocols.
