        If the Request to a primary Dynamic Authorization Server fails, a
        secondary Dynamic Authorization Server must be queried, if
        available; issues relating to failover algorithms are described in
        [RFC3539].  Since this represents a new request, a new Request
        Authenticator and Identifier MUST be used.  However, where the
        Dynamic Authorization Client is sending directly to the NAS,
        failover typically does not make sense, since CoA-Request or
        Disconnect-Request packets need to be delivered to the NAS where
        the session resides.
