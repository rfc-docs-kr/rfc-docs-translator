     For example, within an SS7 network, a Signalling Gateway might be
     charged with representing a set of nodes in the IP domain into the
     SS7 network for routing purposes.  The SG itself, as a signalling
     point in the SS7 network, might also be addressable with an SS7 Point
     Code for MTP3 Management purposes.  The SG Point Code might also be
     used for addressing any local MTP3-Users at the SG such as a local
     SCCP layer.
