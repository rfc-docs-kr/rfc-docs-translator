     This memo discusses the strategy for address assignment of the
     existing 32-bit IPv4 address space with a view toward conserving the
     address space and limiting the growth rate of global routing state.
     This document obsoletes the original Classless Inter-domain Routing
     (CIDR) spec in RFC 1519, with changes made both to clarify the
     concepts it introduced and, after more than twelve years, to update
     the Internet community on the results of deploying the technology
     described.
