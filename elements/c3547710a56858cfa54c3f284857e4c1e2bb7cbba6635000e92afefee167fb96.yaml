     SMTP [RFC2821] servers and clients normally communicate in the clear
     over the Internet.  In many cases, this communication goes through
     one or more router that is not controlled or trusted by either
     entity.  Such an untrusted router might allow a third party to
     monitor or alter the communications between the server and client.
