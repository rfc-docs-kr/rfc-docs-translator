     Classifiers are used to differentiate among types of traffic.  In the
     Differentiated Services architecture, one usually discusses a
     behavior aggregate identified by the application of one or more
     Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs).  However, especially at
     network edges (which include hosts and first hop routers serving
     hosts), traffic may arrive unmarked or the marks may not be trusted.
     In these cases, one applies a Multi-Field Classifier, which may
     select an aggregate as coarse as "all traffic", as fine as a specific
     microflow identified by IP Addresses, IP Protocol, and TCP or UDP
     ports, or variety of slices in between.
