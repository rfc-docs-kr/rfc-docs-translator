      Backup Designated Router
          The Backup Designated Router is also selected on all broadcast
          and NBMA networks by the Hello Protocol.  All routers on the
          attached network become adjacent to both the Designated Router
          and the Backup Designated Router.  The Backup Designated Router
          becomes Designated Router when the current Designated Router
          fails.  The Backup Designated Router is initialized to 0.0.0.0,
          indicating the lack of a Backup Designated Router.
