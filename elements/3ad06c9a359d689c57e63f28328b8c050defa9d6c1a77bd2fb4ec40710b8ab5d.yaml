     This appendix contains an annotated hex dump of a version 2 CRL with
     two extensions (cRLNumber and authorityKeyIdentifier).  The CRL was
     issued by cn=Example CA,dc=example,dc=com on February 5, 2005; the
     next scheduled issuance was February 6, 2005.  The CRL includes one
     revoked certificate: serial number 18, which was revoked on November
     19, 2004 due to keyCompromise.  The CRL itself is number 12, and it
     was signed with RSA and SHA-1.
