     Compressed data is represented in one of three formats: the
     interchange format, the abbreviated format, or the table-
     specification format.  The interchange format contains definitions
     for all the tables used by the entropy-coded segments, while the
     abbreviated format might omit some assuming they were defined out-
     of-band or by a "previous" image.
