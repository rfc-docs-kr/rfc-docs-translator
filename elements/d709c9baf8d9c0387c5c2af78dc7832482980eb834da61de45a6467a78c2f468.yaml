      DESCRIPTION
         "An index that indicates which level of a multi-rate shaper is
         being given its parameters. A multi-rate shaper has some number
         of rate levels. Frame Relay's dual rate specification refers to a
         'committed' and an 'excess' rate; ATM's dual rate specification
         refers to a 'mean' and a 'peak' rate. This table is generalized
         to support an arbitrary number of rates. The committed or mean
         rate is level 1, the peak rate (if any) is the highest level rate
         configured, and if there are other rates they are distributed in
         monotonically increasing order between them."
