     The TransactionID parameter must be the same as that of the
     corresponding TransactionRequest.  A property of root
     (normalMGExecutionTime) is settable by the MGC to indicate the
     interval within which the MGC expects a response to any transaction
     from the MG.  Another property (normalMGCExecutionTime) is settable
     by the MGC to indicate the interval within which the MG should
     expects a response to any transaction from the MGC.  Senders may
     receive more than one TransactionPending for a command.  If a
     duplicate request is received when pending, the responder may send a
     duplicate pending immediately, or continue waiting for its timer to
     trigger another Transaction Pending.
