     If an offerer meets the criteria for the lite mode as described in
     Appendix A of [RFC5245] (i.e., it will always have a public, globally
     unique IP address), it MAY use the lite mode of ICE for TCP
     candidates.  In the lite mode, for TCP candidates, only passive host
     candidates are gathered, unless active candidates are needed as the
     default candidates.  Otherwise, the procedures described for lite
     mode in [RFC5245] also apply to TCP candidates.  If UDP and TCP
     candidates are mixed in a media stream, the mode (lite or full)
     applies to both UDP and TCP candidates.
