              [IP address, mask]
                      Describes the collection of IP addresses contained
                      in the address range. Networks and hosts are
                      assigned to an area depending on whether their
                      addresses fall into one of the area's defining
                      address ranges.  Routers are viewed as belonging to
                      multiple areas, depending on their attached
                      networks' area membership.
