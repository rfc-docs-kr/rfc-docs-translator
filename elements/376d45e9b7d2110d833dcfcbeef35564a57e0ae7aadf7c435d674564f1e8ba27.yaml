     In IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.1X data frames may be sent as Class 3
     unicast data frames, and are therefore forwardable.  This implies
     that while EAPOL-Start and EAPOL-Logoff messages may be authenticated
     and integrity protected, they can be spoofed by an authenticated
     attacker far from the target when "pre-authentication" is enabled.
