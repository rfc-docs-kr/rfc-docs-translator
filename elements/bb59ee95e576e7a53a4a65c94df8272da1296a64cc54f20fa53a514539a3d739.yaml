     Protected result indications address some denial-of-service
     vulnerabilities due to spoofing of Success and Failure packets,
     though not all.  EAP methods can typically provide protected result
     indications only in some circumstances.  For example, errors can
     occur prior to key derivation, and so it may not be possible to
     protect all failure indications.  It is also possible that result
     indications may not be supported in both directions or that
     synchronization may not be achieved in all modes of operation.
