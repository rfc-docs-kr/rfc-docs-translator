     The POINT project is maintaining a testbed with 40 machines across
     Europe, North America (Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)),
     and Japan (National Institute of Information and Communications
     Technology (NICT)) interconnected in a topology containing one
     Topology Manager and one rendezvous node that handle all
     publish/subscribe and topology formation requests [Parisis13].  All
     machines run Blackadder (see Section 4.1).  New nodes can join, and
     experiments can be run on request.
