     As the culmination of a four-year competitive process, NIST (the
     National Institute of Standards and Technology) has selected the AES
     (Advanced Encryption Standard), the successor to the venerable DES
     (Data Encryption Standard).  The competition was an open one, with
     public participation and comment solicited at each step of the
     process.  The AES [AES], formerly known as Rijndael, was chosen from
     a field of five finalists.

  NIST(국립표준기술연구소)는 4년간의 경쟁 과정을 거쳐 유서 깊은 DES(데이터 암호화 표준)의 후속 제품인 AES(고급 암호화 표준)를 선택했습니다. 이번 대회는 공개적인 방식으로 진행되었으며, 프로세스의 각 단계에서 대중의 참여와 의견이 요청되었습니다. 이전에 Rijndael로 알려진 AES[AES]는 5개의 최종 후보 분야에서 선택되었습니다.
