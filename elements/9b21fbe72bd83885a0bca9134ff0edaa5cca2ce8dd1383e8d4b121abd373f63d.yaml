        NOTE -- the RowPointer construct is used to connect the functional
        data paths.  The [MODEL] describes these as TCBs, as an aid to
        understanding.  This MIB, however, does not model TCBs directly.
        It operates at a lower level of abstraction using only individual
        elements, connected in succession by RowPointers.  Therefore, the
        concept of TCBs enclosing individual Functional Data Path elements
        is not directly applicable to this MIB, although management tools
        that use this MIB may employ such a concept.
