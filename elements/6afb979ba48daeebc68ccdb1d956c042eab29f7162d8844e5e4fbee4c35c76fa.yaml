     This new method of assigning address through service providers can be
     put into effect immediately and will, from the start, have the
     benefit of distributing the currently centralized process of
     assigning new addresses. Unfortunately, before the benefit of
     reducing the size of globally-known routing destinations can be
     achieved, it will be necessary to deploy an Inter-Domain routing
     protocol capable of handling arbitrary network and mask pairs. Only
     then will it be possible to aggregate individual class C networks
     into larger blocks represented by single routing table entries.
