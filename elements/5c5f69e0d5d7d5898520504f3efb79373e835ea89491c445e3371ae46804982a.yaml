      The area link-state database consists of the collection of router-
      LSAs, network-LSAs and summary-LSAs that have originated from the
      area's routers.  This information is flooded throughout a single
      area only.  The list of AS-external-LSAs (see Section 5) is also
      considered to be part of each area's link-state database.
