     Entry point to lists of actions.  In the color-blind mode, all three
     classifier "next" entries point to the lower rate meter entry.  In
     the color-aware mode, the AFm1 classifier points to the lower rate
     entry, the AFm2 classifier points to the higher rate entry (as it is
     only compared against that rate), and the AFm3 classifier points
     directly to the actions taken when both rates fail.
