     The use of HTTPS is REQUIRED to ensure that information is not
     modified during transit.  It should be acknowledged that in
     environments where a web server is normally available, there exists
     the possibility that a compromised network might have its WebFinger
     resource operating on HTTPS replaced with one operating only over
     HTTP.  As such, clients MUST NOT issue queries over a non-secure
     connection.

  전송 중에 정보가 수정되지 않도록 하려면 HTTPS를 사용해야 합니다. 웹 서버를 정상적으로 사용할 수 있는 환경에서는 손상된 네트워크에서 HTTPS에서 작동하는 WebFinger 리소스가 HTTP를 통해서만 작동하는 리소스로 대체될 가능성이 있다는 점을 인정해야 합니다. 따라서 클라이언트는 비보안 연결을 통해 쿼리를 실행해서는 안 됩니다.
