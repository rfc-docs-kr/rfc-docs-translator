     "PORT" command and "PASV" response in FTP control session payload
     identify the IP address and TCP port that must be used for the data
     session it supports. The arguments to the PORT command and PASV
     response are an IP address and a TCP port in ASCII. An FTP ALG is
     required to monitor and update the FTP control session payload so
     that information contained in the payload is relevant to end nodes.
     The ALG must also update NAT with appropriate data session tuples and
     session orientation so that NAT could set up state information for
     the FTP data sessions.
