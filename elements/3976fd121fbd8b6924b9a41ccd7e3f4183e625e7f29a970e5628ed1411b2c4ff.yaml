     Note: Implementers should be aware that the connect()/accept()
     function is performed prior to the receipt of the reply from the STOR
     command.  This contrasts the with situation when a non-firewall-
     friendly PORT is used prior to the STOR, and the accept()/connect()
     is performed after the reply from the aforementioned STOR has been
     dealt with.

  참고: 구현자는 STOR 명령으로부터 응답을 받기 전에 connect()/accept() 함수가 수행된다는 점을 알고 있어야 합니다. 이는 STOR 이전에 방화벽 친화적이지 않은 PORT를 사용하고 앞서 언급한 STOR의 응답을 처리한 후 accept()/connect()를 수행하는 상황과 대조됩니다.
