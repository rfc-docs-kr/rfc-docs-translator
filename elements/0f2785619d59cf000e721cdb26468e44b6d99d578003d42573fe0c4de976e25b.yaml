      Method 1:
          Run the entire OSPF functionality over both interfaces, sending
          and receiving hellos, flooding, supporting separate interface
          and neighbor FSMs for each interface, etc. When doing this all
          other routers on the subnet will treat the two interfaces as
          separate neighbors, since neighbors are identified (on broadcast
          and NBMA networks) by their IP address.
