      An OSPF interface can be considered to belong to the area that
      contains the attached network.  All routing protocol packets
      originated by the router over this interface are labelled with the
      interface's Area ID.  One or more router adjacencies may develop
      over an interface.  A router's LSAs reflect the state of its
      interfaces and their associated adjacencies.
