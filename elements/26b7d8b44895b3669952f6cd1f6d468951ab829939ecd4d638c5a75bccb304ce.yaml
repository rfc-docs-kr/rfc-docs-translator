      AS-external-LSAs usually describe a particular external destination.
      For these LSAs the Link State ID field specifies an IP network
      number (if necessary, the Link State ID can also have one or more of
      the network's "host" bits set; see Appendix E for details).  AS-
      external-LSAs are also used to describe a default route.  Default
      routes are used when no specific route exists to the destination.
      When describing a default route, the Link State ID is always set to
      DefaultDestination (0.0.0.0) and the Network Mask is set to 0.0.0.0.
