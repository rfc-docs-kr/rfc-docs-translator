          The correct area border router to use as the packet exits the
          source area is chosen in exactly the same way routers
          advertising external routes are chosen.  Each area border router
          in an area summarizes for the area its cost to all networks
          external to the area.  After the SPF tree is calculated for the
          area, routes to all inter-area destinations are calculated by
          examining the summaries of the area border routers.
