     1.  IPSP Single Exchange (SE) model.  Only a single exchange of ASPTM
        and ASPSM messages is needed to change the IPSP states.  This
        means that a set of requests from one end and acknowledgements
        from the other will be enough.  The RK must define both sides of
        the traffic flow.  Each exchange of ASPTM or ASPSM messages can be
        initiated by either IPSP.  For this exchange, the initiating IPSP
        follows the procedures described in Section 4.3.1.
