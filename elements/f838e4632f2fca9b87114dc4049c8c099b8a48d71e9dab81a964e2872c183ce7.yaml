     Of the first group of fixed mappings, types 0 and 1 are currently
     defined, along with the corresponding types 64 and 65 that indicate
     the presence of restart markers.  They correspond to an abbreviated
     table-specification indicating the "Baseline DCT sequential" mode,
     8-bit samples, square pixels, three components in the YUV color
     space, standard Huffman tables as defined in [1, Annex K.3], and a
     single interleaved scan with a scan component selector indicating
     components 1, 2, and 3 in that order.  The Y, U, and V color planes
     correspond to component numbers 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Component
     1 (i.e., the luminance plane) uses Huffman table number 0 and
     quantization table number 0 (defined below) and components 2 and 3
     (i.e., the chrominance planes) use Huffman table number 1 and
     quantization table number 1 (defined below).
