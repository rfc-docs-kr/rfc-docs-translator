        config:  A hierarchy of configuration data as defined by one of
           the device's data models.  The contents MUST be placed in an
           appropriate namespace, to allow the device to detect the
           appropriate data model, and the contents MUST follow the
           constraints of that data model, as defined by its capability
           definition.  Capabilities are discussed in Section 8.
