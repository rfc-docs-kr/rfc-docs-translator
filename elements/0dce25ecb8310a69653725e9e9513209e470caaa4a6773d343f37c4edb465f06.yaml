     Multiple NAT boxes or multiple links on the same NAT box, sharing the
     same NAT configuration can provide fail-safe backup for each other.
     In such a case, it is necessary for backup NAT device to exchange
     state information so that a backup NAT can take on session load
     transparently when the primary NAT fails. NAT backup becomes simpler,
     when configuration is based on static maps.
