          o   The packet must be authenticated.  The authentication
              procedure is indicated by the setting of AuType (see
              Appendix D).  The authentication procedure may use one or
              more Authentication keys, which can be configured on a per-
              interface basis.  The authentication procedure may also
              verify the checksum field in the OSPF packet header (which,
              when used, is set to the standard IP 16-bit one's complement
              checksum of the OSPF packet's contents after excluding the
              64-bit authentication field).  If the authentication
              procedure fails, the packet should be discarded.
