        IP broadcasts (datagrams with a IP broadcast address) must be sent
        as 802.5 single-route broadcasts.  Unlike ARP, all-routes
        broadcasts are not desirable for IP.  Receiving multiple copies of
        IP broadcasts would have undesirable effects on many protocols
        using IP.  As with ARP, when an IP packet is received, all
        implementations are required to understand frames with no RIF and
        frames with an empty RIF.
