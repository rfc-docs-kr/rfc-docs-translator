                        The DampPeerOscillations option specifies that the
                        implementation engages additional logic to damp
                        the oscillations of BGP peers in the face of
                        sequences of automatic start and automatic stop.
                        IdleHoldTime specifies the length of time the BGP
                        peer is held in the Idle state prior to allowing
                        the next automatic restart.  The IdleHoldTimer is
                        the timer that holds the peer in Idle state.
