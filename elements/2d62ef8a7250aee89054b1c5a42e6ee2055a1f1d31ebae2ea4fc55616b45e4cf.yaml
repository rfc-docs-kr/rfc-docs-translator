              (d) If the new AS external path is still indistinguishable
                  from the current paths in the N's routing table entry,
                  select the preferred path based on a least cost
                  comparison.  Type 1 external paths are compared by
                  looking at the sum of the distance to the forwarding
                  address and the advertised type 1 metric (X+Y).  Type 2
                  external paths advertising equal type 2 metrics are
                  compared by looking at the distance to the forwarding
                  addresses.
