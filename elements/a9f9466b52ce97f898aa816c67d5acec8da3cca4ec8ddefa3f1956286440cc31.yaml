        If the data connection security level is 'Private', then a TLS
        negotiation must take place on the data connection to the
        satisfaction of the Client and Server prior to any data being
        transmitted over the connection.  The TLS layers of the Client and
        Server will be responsible for negotiating the exact TLS Cipher
        Suites that will be used (and thus the eventual security of the
        connection).
