     Description:  The <lock> operation allows the client to lock the
        entire configuration datastore system of a device.  Such locks are
        intended to be short-lived and allow a client to make a change
        without fear of interaction with other NETCONF clients, non-
        NETCONF clients (e.g., SNMP and command line interface (CLI)
        scripts), and human users.
