     Server CPU power has progressed over the years so that TLS can now be
     turned on by default.  However, the risk of malicious clients and
     coordinated groups of clients ("botnets") mounting denial-of-service
     attacks is still very real.  TLS adds another vector for
     computational attacks, since a client can easily (with little
     computational effort) force the server to expend relatively large
     computational work.  It is known that such attacks have in fact been
     mounted.
