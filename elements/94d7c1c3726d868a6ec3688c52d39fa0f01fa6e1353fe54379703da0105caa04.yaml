     Since TWAMP adds an additional Control command beyond the OWAMP-
     Control specification and describes behavior when this control
     command is used, IANA has created a registry for the TWAMP Command
     Number field.  The field is not explicitly named in [RFC4656] but is
     called out for each command.  This field is a recognized extension
     mechanism for TWAMP.
