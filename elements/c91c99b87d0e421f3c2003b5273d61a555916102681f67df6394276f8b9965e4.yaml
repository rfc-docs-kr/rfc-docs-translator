     A Notification Response is only used as confirmation that the peer
     received the Notification Request, not that it has processed it, or
     displayed the message to the user.  It cannot be assumed that the
     contents of the Notification Request or Response are available to
     another method.  The Notification Type is discussed in Section 5.2.
