     Also, traffic is marked with the appropriate DSCP.  The first R bits
     per second are marked AFm1, the next S-R bits per second are marked
     AFm2, and the rest is marked AFm3.  It may be that traffic is
     arriving marked with the same DSCP, but in general, the additional
     complexity of deciding that it is being remarked to the same value is
     not useful.  Therefore, a "mark" action, consisting of an action
     table entry pointing to a mark table entry, is configured.
