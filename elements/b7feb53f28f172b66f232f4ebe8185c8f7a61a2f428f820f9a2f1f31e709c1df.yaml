        device faults will presumably be rare events, so this approach
        represents a substantial optimization of the duplicate detection
        process.  During failover, it is possible for the original record
        to be received after the T-flag-marked record, due to differences
        in network delays experienced along the path by the original and
        duplicate transmissions.  The likelihood of this occurring
        increases as the failover interval is decreased.  In order to be
        able to detect duplicates that are out of order, the Diameter
        server should use backward and forward time windows when
        performing duplicate checking for the T-flag-marked request.  For
        example, in order to allow time for the original record to exit
        the network and be recorded by the accounting server, the Diameter
        server can delay processing records with the T flag set until a
        time period TIME_WAIT + RECORD_PROCESSING_TIME has elapsed after
        the closing of the original transport connection.  After this time
        period, it may check the T-flag-marked records against the
        database with relative assurance that the original records, if
        sent, have been received and recorded.
