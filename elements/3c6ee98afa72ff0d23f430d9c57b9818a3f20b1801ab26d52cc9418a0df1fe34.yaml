     Concatenating the keystream blocks from the successive blocks forms a
     keystream.  The ChaCha20 function then performs an XOR of this
     keystream with the plaintext.  Alternatively, each keystream block
     can be XORed with a plaintext block before proceeding to create the
     next block, saving some memory.  There is no requirement for the
     plaintext to be an integral multiple of 512 bits.  If there is extra
     keystream from the last block, it is discarded.  Specific protocols
     MAY require that the plaintext and ciphertext have certain length.
     Such protocols need to specify how the plaintext is padded and how
     much padding it receives.
