     The generation of an aggregate route is usually specified either
     statically or in response to learning an active dynamic route for a
     prefix contained within the aggregate route.  If such dynamic
     aggregate route advertisement is done, care should be taken that
     routes are not excessively added or withdrawn (known as "route
     flapping").  In general, a dynamic aggregate route advertisement is
     added when at least one component of the aggregate becomes reachable
     and it is withdrawn only when all components become unreachable.
     Properly configured, aggregated routes are more stable than non-
     aggregated routes and thus improve global routing stability.
