        A Diameter proxy server routes messages based on the realm portion
        of a Network Access Identifier (NAI).  The server MUST have a
        table of Realm Names, and the address of the peer to which the
        message must be forwarded.  The routing table MAY also include a
        "default route", which is typically used for all messages that
        cannot be locally processed.
