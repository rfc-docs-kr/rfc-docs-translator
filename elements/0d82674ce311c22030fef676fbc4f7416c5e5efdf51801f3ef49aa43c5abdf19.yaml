     The point is made by Jeff Rulifson at SRI that error checking at major
     software interfaces is always a good thing. He points to some
     experience at SRI where it has saved much dispute and wasted effort.
     On these grounds, we would like to see some HOST to HOST checking.
     Besides checking the software interface, it would also check the
     HOST-IMP transmission hardware.  (BB&N claims the HOST-IMP hardware
     will be as reliable as the internal registers of the HOST.  We believe

  SRI의 Jeff Rulifson은 주요 소프트웨어 인터페이스에서 오류를 검사하는 것이 항상 좋은 것이라고 지적했습니다. 그는 SRI에서 많은 논쟁을 줄이고 노력을 낭비하지 않았던 경험을 지적합니다. 이러한 이유로 우리는 HOST to HOST 검사를 보고 싶습니다. 소프트웨어 인터페이스를 확인하는 것 외에도 HOST-IMP 전송 하드웨어도 확인합니다. (BB&N은 HOST-IMP 하드웨어가 HOST의 내부 레지스터만큼 안정적일 것이라고 주장합니다. 우리는 믿습니다.
