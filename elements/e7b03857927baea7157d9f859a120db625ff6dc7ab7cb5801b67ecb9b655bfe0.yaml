      OSPF allows collections of contiguous networks and hosts to be
      grouped together.  Such a group, together with the routers having
      interfaces to any one of the included networks, is called an area.
      Each area runs a separate copy of the basic link-state routing
      algorithm.  This means that each area has its own link-state
      database and corresponding graph, as explained in the previous
      section.
