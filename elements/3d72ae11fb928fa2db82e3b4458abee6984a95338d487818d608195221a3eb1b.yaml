          In Figure 2, both Router RT5 and RT7 are advertising an external
          route to destination Network N12.  Router RT7 is preferred since
          it is advertising N12 at a distance of 10 (8+2) to Router RT6,
          which is better than Router RT5's 14 (6+8).  Table 3 shows the
          entries that are added to the routing table when external routes
          are examined:
