     Configuration information is by its very nature sensitive.  Its
     transmission in the clear and without integrity checking leaves
     devices open to classic eavesdropping and false data injection
     attacks.  Configuration information often contains passwords, user
     names, service descriptions, and topological information, all of
     which are sensitive.  Because of this, this protocol SHOULD be
     implemented carefully with adequate attention to all manner of attack
     one might expect to experience with other management interfaces.
