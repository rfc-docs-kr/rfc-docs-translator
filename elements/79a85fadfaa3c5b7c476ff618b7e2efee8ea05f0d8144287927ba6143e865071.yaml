           4. Compute the ICV over the ESP packet minus the ICV field.
              Thus, the ICV computation encompasses the SPI, Sequence
              Number, Payload Data, Padding (if present), Pad Length, and
              Next Header.  (Note that the last 4 fields will be in
              ciphertext form, because encryption is performed first.)  If
              the ESN option is enabled for the SA, the high-order 32
              bits of the sequence number are appended after the Next
              Header field for purposes of this computation, but are not
              transmitted.
