     In order to establish communications over a point-to-point link, each
     end of the PPP link first sends LCP packets to configure the data
     link during the Link Establishment phase.  After the link has been
     established, PPP provides for an optional Authentication phase before
     proceeding to the Network-Layer Protocol phase.
