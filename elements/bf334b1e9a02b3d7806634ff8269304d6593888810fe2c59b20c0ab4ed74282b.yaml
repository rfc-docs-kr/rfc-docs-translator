     The goal of this specification is to allow compatible and
     interoperable implementations for transmitting IP datagrams and ARP
     requests and replies.  To achieve this it may be necessary in a few
     cases to limit the use that IP and ARP make of the capabilities of a
     particular IEEE 802 standard.
