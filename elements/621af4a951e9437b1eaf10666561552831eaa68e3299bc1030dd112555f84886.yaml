     The Length field is set to the length in bytes of the quantization
     table data to follow.  The Length field MAY be set to zero to
     indicate that no quantization table data is included in this frame.
     See section 4.2 for more information.  If the Length field in a
     received packet is larger than the remaining number of bytes, the
     packet MUST be discarded.
