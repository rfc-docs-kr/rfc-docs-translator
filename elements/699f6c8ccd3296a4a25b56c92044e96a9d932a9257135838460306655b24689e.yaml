          A virtual link appears in router-LSAs (for the backbone) as if
          it were a separate router interface to the backbone.  As such,
          it has all of the parameters associated with a router interface
          (see Section C.3).  Although a virtual link acts like an
          unnumbered point-to-point link, it does have an associated IP
          interface address.  This address is used as the IP source in
          OSPF protocol packets it sends along the virtual link, and is
          set dynamically during the routing table build process.
          Interface output cost is also set dynamically on virtual links
          to be the cost of the intra-area path between the two routers.
          The parameter RxmtInterval must be configured, and should be
          well over the expected round-trip delay between the two routers.
          This may be hard to estimate for a virtual link; it is better to
          err on the side of making it too large.  Router Priority is not
          used on virtual links.
