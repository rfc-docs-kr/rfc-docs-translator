     In this example, the SGP provides an implementation-dependent nodal
     interworking function (NIF) that allows the MGC to exchange SS7
     signalling messages with the SS7-based SEP.  The NIF within the SGP
     serves as the interface within the SGP between the MTP3 and M3UA.
     This nodal interworking function has no visible peer protocol with
     either the MGC or SEP.  It also provides network status information
     to one or both sides of the network.
