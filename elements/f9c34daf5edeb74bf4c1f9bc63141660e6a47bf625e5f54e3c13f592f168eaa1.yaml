     There are three modes of Application Server traffic handling in the
     SGP M3UA layer: Override, Loadshare and Broadcast.  When included,
     the Traffic Mode Type parameter in the ASP Active message indicates
     the traffic handling mode to be used in a particular Application
     Server.  If the SGP determines that the mode indicated in an ASP
     Active message is unsupported or incompatible with the mode currently
     configured for the AS, the SGP responds with an Error message
     ("Unsupported / Invalid Traffic Handling Mode").  If the traffic
     handling mode of the Application Server is not already known via
     configuration data, then the traffic handling mode indicated in the
     first ASP Active message causing the transition of the Application
     Server state to AS-ACTIVE MAY be used to set the mode.
