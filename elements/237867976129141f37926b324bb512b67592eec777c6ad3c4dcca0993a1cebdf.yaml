     An access device that does not expect to send a re-authorization or a
     session termination request to the server MAY include the Auth-
     Session-State AVP with the value set to NO_STATE_MAINTAINED as a hint
     to the server.  If the server accepts the hint, it agrees that since
     no session termination message will be received once service to the
     user is terminated, it cannot maintain state for the session.  If the
     answer message from the server contains a different value in the
     Auth-Session-State AVP (or the default value if the AVP is absent),
     the access device MUST follow the server's directives.  Note that the
     value NO_STATE_MAINTAINED MUST NOT be set in subsequent re-
     authorization requests and answers.
