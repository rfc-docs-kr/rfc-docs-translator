     It is clear that the way we evaluate IP networks will not be directly
     applicable to evaluating ICN.  In IP, the focus is on the performance
     and characteristics of end-to-end connections between a source and a
     destination.  In ICN, the "source" responding to a request can be any
     ICN node in the network and may change from request to request.  This
     makes it difficult to use concepts like delay and throughput in a
     traditional way.  In addition, evaluating resource usage in ICN is a
     more complicated task, as memory used for caching affects delays and
     use of transmission resources; see the discussion on resource
     equivalents in Section 2.4.
