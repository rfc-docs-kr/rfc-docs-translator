          The OSPF backbone is the special OSPF Area 0 (often written as
          Area 0.0.0.0, since OSPF Area ID's are typically formatted as IP
          addresses). The OSPF backbone always contains all area border
          routers. The backbone is responsible for distributing routing
          information between non-backbone areas. The backbone must be
          contiguous. However, it need not be physically contiguous;
          backbone connectivity can be established/maintained through the
          configuration of virtual links.
