     Implementations of the H.248 protocol SHALL implement IPsec where the
     underlying operating system and the transport network supports IPsec.
     Implementations of the protocol using IPv4 SHALL implement the
     interim AH scheme. However, this interim scheme SHALL NOT be used
     when the underlying network layer supports IPsec. IPv6
     implementations are assumed to support IPsec and SHALL NOT use the
     interim AH scheme.
