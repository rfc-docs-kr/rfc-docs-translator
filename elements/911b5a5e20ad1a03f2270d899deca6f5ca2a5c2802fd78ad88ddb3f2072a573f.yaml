     First, agents SHOULD obtain host candidates as described in
     Section 5.1.  Then, each agent SHOULD "obtain" (allocate a
     placeholder for) an active host candidate for each component of each
     TCP-capable media stream on each interface that the host has.  The
     agent does not yet have to actually allocate a port for these
     candidates, but they are used for the creation of the check lists.
