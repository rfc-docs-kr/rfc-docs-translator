      Link State Update packets provide the mechanism for flooding LSAs.
      A Link State Update packet may contain several distinct LSAs, and
      floods each LSA one hop further from its point of origination.  To
      make the flooding procedure reliable, each LSA must be acknowledged
      separately.  Acknowledgments are transmitted in Link State
      Acknowledgment packets.  Many separate acknowledgments can also be
      grouped together into a single packet.
