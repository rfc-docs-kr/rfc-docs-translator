        RADIUS [RFC2865] defines an application-layer authentication and
        integrity scheme that is required only for use with response
        packets.  While [RFC2869] defines an additional authentication and
        integrity mechanism, use is only required during Extensible
        Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] sessions.  While attribute
        hiding is supported, [RFC2865] does not provide support for per-
        packet confidentiality.  In accounting, [RFC2866] assumes that
        replay protection is provided by the backend billing server rather
        than within the protocol itself.
