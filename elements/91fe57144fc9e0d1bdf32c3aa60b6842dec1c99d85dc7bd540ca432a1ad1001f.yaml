     may be lost by the server, which no longer accepts them after the
     connectivity is re-established.  This state machine is the third
     state machine in this section.  The state machine is supervised by a
     supervision session timer Ts, whose value should be reasonably higher
     than the Acct_Interim_Interval value.  Ts MAY be set to two times the
     value of the Acct_Interim_Interval so as to avoid the accounting
     session in the Diameter server to change to Idle state in case of
     short transient network failure.
