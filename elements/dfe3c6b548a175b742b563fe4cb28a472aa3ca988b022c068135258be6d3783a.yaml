     When ALL is used in the TerminationID of a command, the effect is
     identical to repeating the command with each of the matching
     TerminationIDs.  Since each of these commands may generate a
     response, the size of the entire response may be large.  If
     individual responses are not required, a wildcard response may be
     requested.  In such a case, a single response is generated, which
     contains the UNION of all of the individual responses which otherwise
     would have been generated, with duplicate values suppressed.  For
     instance, given a Termination Ta with properties p1=a, p2=b and
     Termination Tb with properties p2=c, p3=d, a UNION response would
     consist of a wildcarded TerminationId and the sequence of properties
     p1=a, p2=b,c and p3=d.  Wildcard response may be particularly useful
     in the Audit commands.
