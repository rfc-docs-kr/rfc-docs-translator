     8.  A more recent trend of exponential growth beginning in 2004.  The
         best explanation would seem to be an improvement of the global
         economy driving increased expansion of the Internet and the
         continued absence of the "CIDR Police" effort, which previously
         served as an educational tool for new providers to improve
         aggregation efficiency.  There have also been some cases where
         service providers have deliberately de-aggregated prefixes in an
         attempt to mitigate security problems caused by conflicting route
         advertisements (see Section 12).  Although this behavior may
         solve the short-term problems seen by such providers, it is
         fundamentally non-scalable and quite detrimental to the community
         as a whole.  In addition, there appear to be many providers
         advertising both their allocated prefixes and all the /24
         components thereof, probably due to a lack of consistent current
         information about recommended routing configuration.
