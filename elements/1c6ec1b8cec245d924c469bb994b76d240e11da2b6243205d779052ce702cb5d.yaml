              If a Record Route and/or Time Stamp option is received in an
              ICMP Echo Request, this option (these options) SHOULD be
              updated to include the current host and included in the IP
              header of the Echo Reply message, without "truncation".
              Thus, the recorded route will be for the entire round trip.
