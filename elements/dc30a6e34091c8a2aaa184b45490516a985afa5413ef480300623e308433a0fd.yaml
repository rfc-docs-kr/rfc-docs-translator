     Packages may also define new error codes according to the guidelines
     given in section 13.2. This is a matter of documentary convenience:
     the package documentation is submitted to IANA in support of the
     error code registration. If a package is modified, it is unnecessary
     to provide IANA with a new document reference in support of the error
     code unless the description of the error code itself is modified.
