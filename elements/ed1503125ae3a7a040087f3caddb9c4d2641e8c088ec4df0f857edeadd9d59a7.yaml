     In a negotiation attack, the attacker attempts to convince the peer
     and authenticator to negotiate a less secure EAP method.  EAP does
     not provide protection for Nak Response packets, although it is
     possible for a method to include coverage of Nak Responses within a
     method-specific MIC.
