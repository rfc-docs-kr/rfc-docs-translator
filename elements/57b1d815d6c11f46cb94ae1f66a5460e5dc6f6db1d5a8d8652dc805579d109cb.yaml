     Backbone-partitioned stubs should behave as though they were a non-
     partitioned stub. That is, the routers in all partitions should
     maintain routes to the local address spaces of all partitions. Of
     course, the (public) backbones do not maintain routes to any local
     addresses. Therefore, the border routers must tunnel (using VPNs)
     through the backbones using encapsulation.  To do this, each NAT box
     will set aside a global address for tunneling.
