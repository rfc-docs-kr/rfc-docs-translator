     CCN-lite (http://www.ccn-lite.net) is a lightweight implementation of
     the CCN protocol that supports most of the key features of CCNx and
     is interoperable with CCNx.  CCN-lite implements the core CCN logic
     in about 1000 lines of code, so it is ideal for classroom work and
     course projects as well as for quickly experimenting with CCN
     extensions.  For example, Baccelli et al. use CCN-lite on top of the
     RIOT operating system to conduct experiments over an IoT testbed
     [Baccelli14].
