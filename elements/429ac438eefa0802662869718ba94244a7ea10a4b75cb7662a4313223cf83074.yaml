          If a Database Description packet is accepted, the following
          packet fields should be saved in the corresponding neighbor data
          structure under "last received Database Description packet":
          the packet's initialize(I), more (M) and master(MS) bits,
          Options field, and DD sequence number. If these fields are set
          identically in two consecutive Database Description packets
          received from the neighbor, the second Database Description
          packet is considered to be a "duplicate" in the processing
          described below.
