     The solution that the community created was to deprecate the Class
     A/B/C network address assignment system in favor of using
     "classless", hierarchical blocks of IP addresses (referred to as
     prefixes).  The assignment of prefixes is intended to roughly follow
     the underlying Internet topology so that aggregation can be used to
     facilitate scaling of the global routing system.  One implication of
     this strategy is that prefix assignment and aggregation is generally
     done according to provider-subscriber relationships, since that is
     how the Internet topology is determined.
