     This filter contains two containment nodes (<users>, <user>) and one
     selection node (<name>).  All instances of the <name> element in the
     same sibling set are selected in the filter output.  The client might
     need to know that <name> is used as an instance identifier in this
     particular data structure, but the server does not need to know that
     meta-data in order to process the request.
