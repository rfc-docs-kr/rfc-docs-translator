     TLS typically uses certificates [RFC5280] to authenticate peers.
     Implementations MUST support TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] and are REQUIRED to
     support the mandatory to implement cipher suite, which is
     TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA.  This document is assumed to apply to
     future versions of TLS, in which case the mandatory to implement
     cipher suite for the implemented version MUST be supported.
