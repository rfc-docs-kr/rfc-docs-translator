     This document specifies the Source Routing Header (SRH) for use
     strictly between RPL routers in the same RPL routing domain.  A RPL
     routing domain is a collection of RPL routers under the control of a
     single administration.  The boundaries of routing domains are defined
     by network management by setting some links to be exterior, or inter-
     domain, links.
