     Nodes that contain child elements within a subtree filter are called
     "containment nodes".  Each child element can be any type of node,
     including another containment node.  For each containment node
     specified in a subtree filter, all data model instances that exactly
     match the specified namespaces, element hierarchy, and any attribute
     match expressions are included in the filter output.
