     In this example, the <top> and <interfaces> elements are containment
     nodes, the <interface> element is a selection node, and "ifName" is
     an attribute match expression.  Only "interface" nodes in the
     "http://example.com/schema/1.2/config" namespace that have an
     "ifName" attribute with the value "eth0" and occur within
     "interfaces" nodes within "top" nodes will be included in the filter
     output.
