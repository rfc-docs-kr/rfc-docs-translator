     It is, however, important that the maximum delay of retransmissions
     be bounded.  Prior to any retransmission, it is checked that the
     time elapsed since the sending of the initial datagram is no greater
     than T-MAX. If more than T-MAX time has elapsed, the MG concludes
     that the MGC has failed, and it begins its recovery process. The MG
     shall use a ServiceChange with ServiceChangeMethod set to
     Disconnected so that the new MGC will be aware that the MG lost one
     or more transactions.  The value T-MAX is related to the LONG-TIMER
     value: the LONG-TIMER value is obtained by adding to T-MAX the
     maximum propagation delay in the network.
