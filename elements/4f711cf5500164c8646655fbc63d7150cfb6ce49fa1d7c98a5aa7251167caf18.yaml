          As an example of the calculation, consider the Autonomous System
          pictured in Figure 17.  There is a single non-backbone area
          (Area 1) that physically divides the backbone into two separate
          pieces. To maintain connectivity of the backbone, a virtual link
          has been configured between routers RT1 and RT4. On the right
          side of the figure, Network N1 belongs to the backbone. The
          dotted lines indicate that there is a much shorter intra-area
