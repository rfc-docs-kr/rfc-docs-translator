     Any node can initiate a request.  In that sense, Diameter is a peer-
     to-peer protocol.  In this document, a Diameter client is a device at
     the edge of the network that performs access control, such as a
     Network Access Server (NAS) or a Foreign Agent (FA).  A Diameter
     client generates Diameter messages to request authentication,
     authorization, and accounting services for the user.  A Diameter
     agent is a node that does not provide local user authentication or
     authorization services; agents include proxies, redirects, and relay
     agents.  A Diameter server performs authentication and/or
     authorization of the user.  A Diameter node may act as an agent for
     certain requests while acting as a server for others.
