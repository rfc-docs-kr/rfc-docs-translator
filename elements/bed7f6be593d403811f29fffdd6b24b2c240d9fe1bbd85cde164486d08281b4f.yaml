           Description: The BGP FSM normally tracks the end result of a
                        TCP connection attempt rather than individual TCP
                        messages.  Optionally, the BGP FSM can support
                        additional interaction with the TCP connection
                        negotiation.  The interaction with the TCP events
                        may increase the amount of logging the BGP peer
                        connection requires and the number of BGP FSM
                        changes.
