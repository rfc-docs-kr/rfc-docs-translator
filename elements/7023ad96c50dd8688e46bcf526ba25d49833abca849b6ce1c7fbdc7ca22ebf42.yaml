     This example eliminates the need for the TWAMP-Control protocol, and
     assumes that the Session-Reflector is configured and communicates its
     configuration with the Server through non-standard means.  The
     Session-Reflector simply reflects the incoming packets back to the
     controller while copying the necessary information and generating
     sequence number and timestamp values per Section 4.2.1. TWAMP Light
     introduces some additional security considerations.  The non-standard
     means to control the responder and establish test sessions SHOULD
     offer the features listed below.
