     Using such a protected exchange, it is possible to match the channel
     properties provided by the authenticator via out-of-band mechanisms
     against those exchanged within the EAP method.  Where discrepancies
     are found, these SHOULD be logged; additional actions MAY also be
     taken, such as denying access.
