              In NBMA mode, OSPF emulates operation over a broadcast
              network: a Designated Router is elected for the NBMA
              network, and the Designated Router originates an LSA for the
              network. The graph representation for broadcast networks and
              NBMA networks is identical. This representation is pictured
              in the middle of Figure 1a.
