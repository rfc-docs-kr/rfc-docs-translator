     In this example, the filter contains one containment node
     (<interfaces>), one attribute match expression ("ifName"), and one
     selection node (<interface>).  All instances of the <interface>
     subtree that have an "ifName" attribute equal to "eth0" are selected
     in the filter output.  The filter data elements and attributes are
     qualified because the "ifName" attribute will not be considered part
     of the "schema/1.2" namespace if it is unqualified.
