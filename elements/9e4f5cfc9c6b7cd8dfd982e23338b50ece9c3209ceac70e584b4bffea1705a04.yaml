          Router Priority
              An 8-bit unsigned integer.  When two routers attached to a
              network both attempt to become Designated Router, the one
              with the highest Router Priority takes precedence.  If there
              is still a tie, the router with the highest Router ID takes
              precedence.  A router whose Router Priority is set to 0 is
              ineligible to become Designated Router on the attached
              network.  Router Priority is only configured for interfaces
              to broadcast and NBMA networks.
