      The format of the Database Description packet is very similar to
      both the Link State Request and Link State Acknowledgment packets.
      The main part of all three is a list of items, each item describing
      a piece of the link-state database.  The sending of Database
      Description Packets is documented in Section 10.8.  The reception of
      Database Description packets is documented in Section 10.6.
