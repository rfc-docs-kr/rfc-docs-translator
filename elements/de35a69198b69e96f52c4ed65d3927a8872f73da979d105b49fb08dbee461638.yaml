     Terminations representing physical entities have a semi-permanent
     existence.  For example, a Termination representing a TDM channel
     might exist for as long as it is provisioned in the gateway.
     Terminations representing ephemeral information flows, such as RTP
     flows, would usually exist only for the duration of their use.
