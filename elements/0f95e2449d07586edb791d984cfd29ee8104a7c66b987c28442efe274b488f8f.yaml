     A Diameter application document MUST define the exact concept of a
     session that is being accounted, and it MAY define the concept of a
     multi-session.  For instance, the NASREQ DIAMETER application treats
     a single PPP connection to a Network Access Server as one session and
     a set of Multilink PPP sessions as one multi-session.
