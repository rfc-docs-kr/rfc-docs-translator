     The ASP must choose an SGP to direct a message to the SS7 network.
     This is accomplished by observing the Destination Point Code (and
     possibly other elements of the outgoing message, such as the SLS
     value).  The ASP must also take into account whether the related
     Routing Context is active or not (see Section 4.3.4.3).
