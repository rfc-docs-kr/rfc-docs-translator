     NAT devices, when combined with ALGs, can ensure that the datagrams
     injected into Internet have no private addresses in headers or
     payload. Applications that do not meet these requirements may be
     dropped using firewall filters. For this reason, it is not uncommon
     to find NAT, ALG and firewall functions co-exist to provide security
     at the borders of a private network. NAT gateways can be used as
     tunnel end points to provide secure VPN transport of packet data
     across an external network domain.
