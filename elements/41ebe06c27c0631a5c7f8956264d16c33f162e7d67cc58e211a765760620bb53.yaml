              A router that has formerly been the Designated Router for a
              network, but is no longer, should flush the network-LSA that
              it had previously originated.  This LSA is no longer used in
              the routing table calculation.  It is flushed by prematurely
              incrementing the LSA's age to MaxAge and reflooding (see
              Section 14.1). In addition, in those rare cases where a
              router's Router ID has changed, any network-LSAs that were
              originated with the router's previous Router ID must be
              flushed. Since the router may have no idea what it's
              previous Router ID might have been, these network-LSAs are
              indicated by having their Link State ID equal to one of the
              router's IP interface addresses and their Advertising Router
              equal to some value other than the router's current Router
              ID (see Section 13.4 for more details).
