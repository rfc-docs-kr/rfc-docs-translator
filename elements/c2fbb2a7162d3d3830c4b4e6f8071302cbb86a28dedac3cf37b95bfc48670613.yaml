     Case 2 also occurs whenever a RPL router needs to insert a source
     route when forwarding a datagram.  One such use case with RPL is to
     have all RPL traffic flow through a Border Router and have the Border
     Router use source routes to deliver datagrams to their final
     destination.  When including the SRH using tunneled mode, the Border
     Router would encapsulate the received datagram unmodified using IPv6-
     in-IPv6 and include an SRH in the outer IPv6 header.
