          The "forwarding address" has one other application.  It enables
          routers in the Autonomous System's interior to function as
          "route servers".  For example, in Figure 2 the router RT6 could
          become a route server, gaining external routing information
          through a combination of static configuration and external
          routing protocols.  RT6 would then start advertising itself as
          an AS boundary router, and would originate a collection of OSPF
          AS-external-LSAs.  In each AS-external-LSA, Router RT6 would
          specify the correct Autonomous System exit point to use for the
          destination through appropriate setting of the LSA's "forwarding
          address" field.
