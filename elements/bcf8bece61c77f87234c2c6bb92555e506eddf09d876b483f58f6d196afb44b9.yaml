     If the use of "all ones" in a field of an IP address means
     "broadcast", using "all zeros" could be viewed as meaning
     "unspecified".  There is probably no reason for such addresses to
     appear anywhere but as the source address of an ICMP Information
     Request datagram.  However, as a notational convention, we refer to
     networks (as opposed to hosts) by using addresses with zero fields.
     For example, 36.0.0.0 means "network number 36" while 36.255.255.255
     means "all hosts on network number 36".
