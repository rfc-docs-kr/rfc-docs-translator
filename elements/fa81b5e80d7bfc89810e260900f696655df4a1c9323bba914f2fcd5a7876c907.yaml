     2.  A router that generates an aggregate route for multiple, more-
         specific routes must discard packets that match the aggregate
         route, but not any of the more-specific routes.  In other words,
         the "next hop" for the aggregate route should be the null
         destination.  This is necessary to prevent forwarding loops when
         some addresses covered by the aggregate are not reachable.
