     A namespace is considered to match (for filter purposes) if the XML
     namespace associated with a particular node within the <filter>
     element is the same as in the underlying data model.  Note that
     namespace selection cannot be used by itself.  At least one element
     MUST be specified in the filter if any elements are to be included in
     the filter output.
