              For example, consider a valid_policy_tree with a node of
              depth i-1 where the expected_policy_set is {Gold, White}.
              Assume the certificate policies Gold and Silver appear in
              the certificate policies extension of certificate i.  The
              Gold policy is matched but the Silver policy is not.  This
              rule will generate a child node of depth i for the Gold
              policy. The result is shown as Figure 4.
