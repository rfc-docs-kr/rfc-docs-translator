     Server reflexive techniques aim to discover the address a NAT has
     given for the host by asking that from a server on the other side of
     the NAT and then creating proper bindings (unless such already exist)
     on the NATs with connectivity checks sent between the hosts.  Success
     of these techniques depends on the NATs' mapping and filtering
     behavior [RFC5382] and also on whether the NATs and hosts support the
     TCP simultaneous-open technique.
