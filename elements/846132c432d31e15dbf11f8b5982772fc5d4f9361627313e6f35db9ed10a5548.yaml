           Software should be written to deal with every conceivable
           error, no matter how unlikely; sooner or later a packet will
           come in with that particular combination of errors and
           attributes, and unless the software is prepared, chaos can
           ensue.  In general, it is best to assume that the network is
           filled with malevolent entities that will send in packets
           designed to have the worst possible effect.  This assumption
           will lead to suitable protective design, although the most
           serious problems in the Internet have been caused by
           unenvisaged mechanisms triggered by low-probability events;
