     In addition to using the Basic AVP Data Formats, applications may
     define data formats derived from the Basic AVP Data Formats.  An
     application that defines new Derived AVP Data Formats MUST include
     them in a section titled "Derived AVP Data Formats", using the same
     format as the definitions below.  Each new definition MUST be either
     defined or listed with a reference to the RFC that defines the
     format.
