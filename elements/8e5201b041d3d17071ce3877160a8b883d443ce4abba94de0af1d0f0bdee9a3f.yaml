     During verification, the higher the score, the more likely it is that
     the speaker is the same one as the one who spoke the voiceprint
     utterances.  During training, the higher the score, the more likely
     the speaker is to have spoken all of the analyzed utterances.  The
     value is a floating point between -1.0 and 1.0.  If there are no such
     utterances, the score is -1.  Note that the verification score is not
     a probability value.

  검증하는 동안 점수가 높을수록 화자가 음성 지문 발화를 말한 사람과 동일할 가능성이 높습니다. 훈련하는 동안 점수가 높을수록 화자가 분석된 모든 발화를 말했을 가능성이 높습니다. 값은 -1.0과 1.0 사이의 부동 소수점입니다. 그러한 발화가 없으면 점수는 -1입니다. 검증 점수는 확률 값이 아니라는 점에 유의하세요.
