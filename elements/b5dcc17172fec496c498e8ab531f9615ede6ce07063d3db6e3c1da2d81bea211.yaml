     An access device that receives an RAR message with the Session-Id
     equal to a currently active session MUST initiate a re-auth towards
     the user, if the service supports this particular feature.  Each
     Diameter application MUST state whether server-initiated re-auth is
     supported, since some applications do not allow access devices to
     prompt the user for re-auth.
