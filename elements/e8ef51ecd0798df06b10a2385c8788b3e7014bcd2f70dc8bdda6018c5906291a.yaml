     In this example, the <users> and <user> nodes are both containment
     nodes, and <name> is a content match node.  Since no sibling nodes of
     <name> are specified (and therefore no containment or selection
     nodes), all of the sibling nodes of <name> are returned in the filter
     output.  Only "user" nodes in the
     "http://example.com/schema/1.2/config" namespace that match the
     element hierarchy and for which the <name> element is equal to "fred"
     will be included in the filter output.
