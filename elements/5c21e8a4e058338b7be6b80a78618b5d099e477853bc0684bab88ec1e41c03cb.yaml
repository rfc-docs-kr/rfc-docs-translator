     Several studies in the past few years have stated that Zipf's law is
     the discrete distribution that best represents the request frequency
     in a number of application scenarios, ranging from the Web to VoD
     services.  The key aspect of this distribution is that the frequency
     of a content request is inversely proportional to the rank of the
     content itself, i.e., the smaller the rank, the higher the request
     frequency.  If M denotes the content catalog cardinality and 1 <= i
     <= M denotes the rank of the i-th most popular content, we can
     express the probability of requesting the content with rank "i" as:
