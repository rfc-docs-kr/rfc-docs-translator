                 The Broadcast Indicators are used to indicate the routing
                 desired for a particular frame.  A frame may be routed
                 through a single specified route, through every distinct
                 non-repeating route in a multi-ring network, or through a
                 single route determined by a spanning tree algorithm such
                 that the frame appears on every ring exactly once.  The
                 values which may be used at this time are (in binary):
