              DISCUSSION:
                   Passing all received IP options to the transport layer
                   is a deliberate "violation of strict layering" that is
                   designed to ease the introduction of new transport-
                   relevant IP options in the future.  Each layer must
                   pick out any options that are relevant to its own
                   processing and ignore the rest.  For this purpose,
                   every IP option except NOP and END-OF-LIST will include
                   a specification of its own length.
