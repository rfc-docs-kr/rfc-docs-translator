      Path-type
          There are four possible types of paths used to route traffic to
          the destination, listed here in decreasing order of preference:
          intra-area, inter-area, type 1 external or type 2 external.
          Intra-area paths indicate destinations belonging to one of the
          router's attached areas.  Inter-area paths are paths to
          destinations in other OSPF areas.  These are discovered through
          the examination of received summary-LSAs.  AS external paths are
          paths to destinations external to the AS.  These are detected
          through the examination of received AS-external-LSAs.
