     Integrity protection of TWAMP follows the same procedure defined in
     Section 3.2 of OWAMP [RFC4656].  As in OWAMP, each HMAC (Hashed
     Message Authentication Code) sent covers everything sent in a given
     direction between the previous HMAC (but not including it) and the
     start of the new HMAC.  This way, once encryption is set up, each bit
     of the TWAMP-Control connection is authenticated by an HMAC exactly
     once.
