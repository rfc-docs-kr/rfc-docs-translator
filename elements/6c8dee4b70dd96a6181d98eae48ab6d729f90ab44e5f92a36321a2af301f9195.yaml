     With the described scheme many large enterprises will need only a
     relatively small block of addresses from the globally unique IP
     address space.  The Internet at large benefits through conservation
     of globally unique address space which will effectively lengthen the
     lifetime of the IP address space. The enterprises benefit from the
     increased flexibility provided by a relatively large private address
     space.
