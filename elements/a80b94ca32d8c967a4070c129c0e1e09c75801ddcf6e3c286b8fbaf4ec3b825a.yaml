          The procedure will be explained using the graph terminology that
          was introduced in Section 2.  The area's link state database is
          represented as a directed graph.  The graph's vertices are
          routers, transit networks and stub networks.  The first stage of
          the procedure concerns only the transit vertices (routers and
          transit networks) and their connecting links.  Throughout the
          shortest path calculation, the following data is also associated
          with each transit vertex:
