          Router entries are kept for area border routers and AS boundary
          routers.  Routing table entries for area border routers are used
          when calculating the inter-area routes (see Section 16.2), and
          when maintaining configured virtual links (see Section 15).
          Routing table entries for AS boundary routers are used when
          calculating the AS external routes (see Section 16.4).
