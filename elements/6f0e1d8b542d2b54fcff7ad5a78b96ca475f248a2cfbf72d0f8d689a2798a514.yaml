     If a server were to authenticate the peer and send a Success packet
     prior to determining whether the peer has authenticated the
     authenticator, an idle timeout can occur if the authenticator is not
     authenticated by the peer.  Where supported by the lower layer, an
     authenticator sensing the absence of the peer can free resources.
