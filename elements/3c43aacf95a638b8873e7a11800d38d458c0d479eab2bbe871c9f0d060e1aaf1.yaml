     The AES will be the government's designated encryption cipher.  The
     expectation is that the AES will suffice to protect sensitive
     (unclassified) government information until at least the next
     century.  It is also expected to be widely adopted by businesses and
     financial institutions.

  AES는 정부가 지정한 암호화 암호입니다. AES는 최소한 다음 세기까지 민감한(비분류) 정부 정보를 보호하는 데 충분할 것으로 예상됩니다. 기업과 금융기관에서도 널리 채택될 것으로 예상된다.
