              The application layer MUST be able to specify the Type-of-
              Service (TOS) for segments that are sent on a connection.
              It not required, but the application SHOULD be able to
              change the TOS during the connection lifetime.  TCP SHOULD
              pass the current TOS value without change to the IP layer,
              when it sends segments on the connection.
