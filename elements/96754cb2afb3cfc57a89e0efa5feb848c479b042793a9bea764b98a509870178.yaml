                  Consider once again the AS pictured in Figure 6.  There
                  are two AS boundary routers: RT5 and RT7.  Router RT5
                  originates three AS-external-LSAs, for networks N12-N14.
                  Router RT7 originates two AS-external-LSAs, for networks
                  N12 and N15.  Assume that RT7 has learned its route to
                  N12 via BGP, and that it wishes to advertise a Type 2
                  metric to the AS.  RT7 would then originate the
                  following LSA for N12:
