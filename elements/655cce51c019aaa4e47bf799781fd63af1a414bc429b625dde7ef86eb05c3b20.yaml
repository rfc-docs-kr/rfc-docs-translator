         2a.  The name parts match if the two names are identical
              character by character, except that it is RECOMMENDED that
              case be ignored as defined in "i;unicode-casemap - Simple
              Unicode Collation Algorithm" [RFC5051].  For example,
              'Ajax-letter-head-white' MUST match 'Ajax-letter-head-white'
              and SHOULD match 'ajax-letter-head-white' and
              'AJAX-LETTER-HEAD-WHITE'.
