      All OSPF protocol exchanges are authenticated. OSPF supports
      multiple types of authentication; the type of authentication in use
      can be configured on a per network segment basis. One of OSPF's
      authentication types, namely the Cryptographic authentication
      option, is believed to be secure against passive attacks and provide
      significant protection against active attacks. When using the
      Cryptographic authentication option, each router appends a "message
      digest" to its transmitted OSPF packets. Receivers then use the
      shared secret key and received digest to verify that each received
      OSPF packet is authentic.
