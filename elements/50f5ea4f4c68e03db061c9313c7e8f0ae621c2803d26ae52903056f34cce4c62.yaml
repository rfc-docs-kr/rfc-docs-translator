     Although there are no known defects with the PKCS #1 v1.5 [P1v1.5]
     signature algorithm, RSASSA-PSS [P1v2.1] was developed in an effort
     to have more mathematically provable security.  PKCS #1 v1.5
     signatures were developed in an ad hoc manner; RSASSA-PSS was
     developed based on mathematical foundations.

  PKCS #1 v1.5 [P1v1.5] 서명 알고리즘에는 알려진 결함이 없지만 RSASSA-PSS [P1v2.1]은 수학적으로 더 입증 가능한 보안을 확보하려는 노력의 일환으로 개발되었습니다. PKCS #1 v1.5 서명은 임시 방식으로 개발되었습니다. RSASSA-PSS는 수학적 기초를 기반으로 개발되었습니다.
