     It is more likely that new parameterization tables will be created in
     other MIBs as new methods or proprietary methods get deployed for
     existing Differentiated Services Functional Data Path Elements.  For

     filter parameterization tables.  New scheduling methods can be
     deployed by defining new scheduling method OIDs and new scheduling
     parameter tables.
