     From a syntactic viewpoint, digit maps are strings with syntactic
     restrictions imposed upon them.  The syntax of valid digit maps is
     specified in ABNF [RFC 2234].  The syntax for digit maps presented in
     this section is for illustrative purposes only. The definition of
     digitMap in Annex B takes precedence in the case of differences
     between the two.
