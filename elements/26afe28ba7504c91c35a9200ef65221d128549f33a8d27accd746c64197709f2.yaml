     IV
        The Initialization Vector (IV) SHOULD be chosen at random, and
        MUST be unpredictable.  Note that in versions of TLS prior to 1.1,
        there was no IV field, and the last ciphertext block of the
        previous record (the "CBC residue") was used as the IV.  This was
        changed to prevent the attacks described in [CBCATT].  For block
        ciphers, the IV length is of length
        SecurityParameters.record_iv_length, which is equal to the
        SecurityParameters.block_size.

  IV - 초기화 벡터(IV)는 무작위로 선택되어야 하며 예측할 수 없어야 합니다. 1.1 이전 버전의 TLS에는 IV 필드가 없었고 이전 레코드의 마지막 암호문 블록("CBC 잔여물")이 IV로 사용되었습니다. 이는 [CBCATT]에 설명된 공격을 방지하기 위해 변경되었습니다. 블록 암호의 경우 IV 길이는 SecurityParameters.record_iv_length이며, 이는 SecurityParameters.block_size와 동일합니다.
