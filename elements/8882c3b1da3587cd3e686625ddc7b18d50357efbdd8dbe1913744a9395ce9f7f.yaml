     To gain this confidence, the application can run tests of the
     operational state of the device.  The nature of the test is dependent
     on the nature of the change and is outside the scope of this
     document.  Such tests may include reachability from the system
     running the application (using ping), changes in reachability to the
     rest of the network (by comparing the device's routing table), or
     inspection of the particular change (looking for operational evidence
     of the BGP peer that was just added).
