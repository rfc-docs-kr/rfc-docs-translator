           Development, evolution, and revision are characteristic of
           computer network protocols today, and this situation will
           persist for some years.  A vendor who develops computer
           communication software for the Internet protocol suite (or any
           other protocol suite!) and then fails to maintain and update
           that software for changing specifications is going to leave a
           trail of unhappy customers.  The Internet is a large
           communication network, and the users are in constant contact
           through it.  Experience has shown that knowledge of
           deficiencies in vendor software propagates quickly through the
           Internet technical community.
