     Alternatively, a subscriber (e.g., a site) may choose to operate as a
     part of a domain formed by a service provider. We assume that some,
     if not most, sites will prefer to operate as part of their provider's
     routing domain.  Such sites can exchange routing information with
     their provider via interior routing protocol route leaking or via an
     exterior routing protocol.  For the purposes of this discussion, the
     choice is not significant.  The site is still allocated a prefix from
     the provider's address space, and the provider will advertise its own
     prefix into inter-domain routing.
