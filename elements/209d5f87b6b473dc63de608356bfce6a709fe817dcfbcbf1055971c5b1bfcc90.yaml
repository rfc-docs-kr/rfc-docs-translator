     To avoid fragmentation, it is desirable to employ MTU sizes that
     allow for the header expansion (i.e., at least 1280 + 40 (outer IP
     header) + SRH_MAX_SIZE), where SRH_MAX_SIZE is the maximum path
     length for a given RPL network.  To take advantage of this, however,
     the communicating endpoints need to be aware of the MTU along the
     path (i.e., through Path MTU Discovery).  Unfortunately, the larger
     MTU size may not be available on all links (e.g., 1280 octets on IPv6
     Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) links).  However,
     it is expected that much of the traffic on these types of networks
     consists of much smaller messages than the MTU, so performance
     degradation through fragmentation would be limited.
