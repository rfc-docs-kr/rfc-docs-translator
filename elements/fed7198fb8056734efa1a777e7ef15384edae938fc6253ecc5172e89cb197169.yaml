                   o    The ping (ICMP Echo) would be sent again if
                        necessary, up to N times.  If no ping reply was
                        received in N tries, the gateway would be assumed
                        to have failed, and a new first-hop gateway would
                        be chosen for all cache entries pointing to the
                        failed gateway.
