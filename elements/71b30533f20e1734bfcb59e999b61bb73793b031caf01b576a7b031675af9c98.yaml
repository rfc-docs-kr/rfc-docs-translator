     A STUN amplification attack is described in Section 18.5.2 of
     [RFC5245].  The same considerations apply to TCP, but the
     amplification effect with TCP is larger due to need for establishing
     a TCP connection before any checks are performed.  Therefore, an ICE
     agent SHOULD NOT have more than 5 outstanding TCP connection attempts
     with the same peer to the same IP address.
