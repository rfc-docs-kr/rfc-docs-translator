        In the second case, each other provider (e.g., backbone or TRD)
        sees a single address prefix for the provider, which encompasses
        the new site. This avoids the exchange of additional routing
        information to identify the new site's address prefix. Thus, the
        advantages primarily accrue to other providers which maintain
        routing information about this site and provider.
