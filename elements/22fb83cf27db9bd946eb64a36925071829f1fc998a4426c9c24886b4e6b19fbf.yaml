     For registration requests where a Designated Expert should be
     consulted, the responsible IESG area director should appoint the
     Designated Expert.  The intention is that any allocation will be
     accompanied by a published RFC.  But in order to allow for the
     allocation of values prior to the RFC being approved for publication,
     the Designated Expert can approve allocations once it seems clear
     that an RFC will be published.  The Designated expert will post a
     request to the EAP WG mailing list (or a successor designated by the
     Area Director) for comment and review, including an Internet-Draft.
     Before a period of 30 days has passed, the Designated Expert will
     either approve or deny the registration request and publish a notice
     of the decision to the EAP WG mailing list or its successor, as well
     as informing IANA.  A denial notice must be justified by an
     explanation, and in the cases where it is possible, concrete
     suggestions on how the request can be modified so as to become
     acceptable should be provided.
