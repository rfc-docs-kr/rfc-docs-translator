          (3) Call the destination described by the LSA N.  N's address is
              obtained by masking the LSA's Link State ID with the
              network/subnet mask contained in the body of the LSA.  Look
              up the routing table entries (potentially one per attached
              area) for the AS boundary router (ASBR) that originated the
              LSA. If no entries exist for router ASBR (i.e., ASBR is
              unreachable), do nothing with this LSA and consider the next
              in the list.
