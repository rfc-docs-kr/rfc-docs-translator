          The OSPF Working Group of the IETF has extended this work in
          developing the OSPF protocol.  The Designated Router concept has
          been greatly enhanced to further reduce the amount of routing
          traffic required.  Multicast capabilities are utilized for
          additional routing bandwidth reduction.  An area routing scheme
          has been developed enabling information
          hiding/protection/reduction.  Finally, the algorithms have been
          tailored for efficient operation in TCP/IP internets.
