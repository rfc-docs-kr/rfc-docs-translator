              DISCUSSION:
                   Some Internet protocol experts have maintained that
                   when a host sends an identical copy of an earlier
                   datagram, the new copy should contain the same
                   Identification value as the original.  There are two
                   suggested advantages:  (1) if the datagrams are
                   fragmented and some of the fragments are lost, the
                   receiver may be able to reconstruct a complete datagram
                   from fragments of the original and the copies; (2) a
                   congested gateway might use the IP Identification field
                   (and Fragment Offset) to discard duplicate datagrams
                   from the queue.
