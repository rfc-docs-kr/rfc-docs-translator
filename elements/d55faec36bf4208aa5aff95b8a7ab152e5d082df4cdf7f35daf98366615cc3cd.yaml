     Rates may be expressed as absolute rates, or as a fraction of
     ifSpeed, and imply the use of a rate-based scheduler such as WFQ or
     WRR.  The use of a priority implies the use of a Priority Scheduler.
     Only one of the Absolute or Relative rates needs to be set; the other
     takes the relevant value as a result.  Excess capacity is distributed
     proportionally among the inputs to a scheduler using the assured
     rate.  More complex functionality may be described by augmenting this
     MIB.
