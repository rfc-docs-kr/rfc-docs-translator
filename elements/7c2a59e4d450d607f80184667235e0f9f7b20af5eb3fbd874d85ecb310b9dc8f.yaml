        These notifications are not based on the SGP reporting the state
        change of an ASP or AS.  In the Insufficient ASP Resources case,
        the SGP is indicating to an ASP_INACTIVE ASP in the AS that
        another ASP is required to handle the load of the AS (Loadsharing
        or Broadcast mode).  For the Alternate ASP Active case, an ASP is
        informed when an alternate ASP transitions to the ASP-ACTIVE state
        in Override mode.  The ASP Identifier (if available) of the
        Alternate ASP MUST be placed in the message.  For the ASP Failure
        case, the SGP is indicating to ASPs in the AS that one of the
        ASPs has failed.  The ASP Identifier (if available) of the failed
        ASP MUST be placed in the message.
