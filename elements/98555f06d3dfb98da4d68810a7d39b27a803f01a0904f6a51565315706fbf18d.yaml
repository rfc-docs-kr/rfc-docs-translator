        A particular implementation of an IEEE 802.3 Physical Layer is
        denoted using a three field notation.  The three fields are data
        rate in megabit/second, medium type, and maximum segment length in
        hundreds of meters.  One combination of of 802.3 parameters is
        10BASE5 which specifies a 10 megabit/second transmission rate,
        baseband medium, and 500 meter segments.  This correspondes to the
        specifications of the familiar "Ethernet" network.
