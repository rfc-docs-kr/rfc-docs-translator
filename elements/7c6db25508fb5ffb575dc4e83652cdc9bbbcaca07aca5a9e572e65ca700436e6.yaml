     This memo defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7
     MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the
     services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol.  Also,
     provision is made for protocol elements that enable a seamless
     operation of the MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains.  This
     protocol would be used between a Signalling Gateway (SG) and a Media
     Gateway Controller (MGC) or IP-resident Database, or between two IP-
     based applications.  It is assumed that the SG receives SS7
     signalling over a standard SS7 interface using the SS7 Message
     Transfer Part (MTP) to provide transport.  This document obsoletes
     RFC 3332.
