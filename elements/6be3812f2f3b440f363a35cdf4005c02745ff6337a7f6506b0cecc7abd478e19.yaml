          Some capabilities must be supported by all routers attached to a
          specific area.  In this case, a router will not accept a
          neighbor's Hello Packet unless there is a match in reported
          capabilities (i.e., a capability mismatch prevents a neighbor
          relationship from forming).  An example of this is the
          ExternalRoutingCapability (see below).
