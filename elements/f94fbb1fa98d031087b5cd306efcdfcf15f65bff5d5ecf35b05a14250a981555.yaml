     The current practice is to assign globally unique addresses to all
     hosts that use TCP/IP.  There is a growing concern that the finite IP
     address space might become exhausted.  Therefore, the guidelines for
     assigning IP address space have been tightened in recent years [1].
     These rules are often more conservative than enterprises would like,
     in order to implement and operate their networks.
