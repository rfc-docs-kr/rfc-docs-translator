     The encapsulation of EAP over IEEE 802 is defined in [IEEE-802.1X].
     The IEEE 802 encapsulation of EAP does not involve PPP, and IEEE
     802.1X does not include support for link or network layer
     negotiations.  As a result, within IEEE 802.1X, it is not possible to
     negotiate non-EAP authentication mechanisms, such as PAP or CHAP
     [RFC1994].
