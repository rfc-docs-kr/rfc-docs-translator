        With 'Clear' protection level, the data connection is made without
        TLS.  Thus, the connection is unauthenticated and has no
        confidentiality or integrity.  This might be the desired behaviour
        for servers sending file lists, pre-encrypted data, or non-
        sensitive data (e.g., for anonymous FTP servers).
