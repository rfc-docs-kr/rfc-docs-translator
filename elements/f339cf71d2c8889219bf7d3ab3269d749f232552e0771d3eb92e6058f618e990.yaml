     (Note 2) The Reply-Message Attribute is used to present a displayable
     message to the user.  The message is only displayed as a result of a
     successful Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request (where a Disconnect-ACK
     or CoA-ACK is subsequently sent).  Where Extension Authentication
     Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication, an EAP-
     Message/Notification-Request Attribute is sent instead, and
     Disconnect-ACK or CoA-ACK packets contain an EAP-
     Message/Notification-Response Attribute.
