     If an ICE restart occurs for a media stream with TCP candidate pairs
     that have been selected by ICE, the agents MUST NOT close the
     connections after the restart.  In the offer or answer that causes
     the restart, an agent MAY include a simultaneous-open candidate whose
     transport address matches the previously selected candidate.  If both
     agents do this, the result will be a simultaneous-open candidate pair
     matching an existing TCP connection.  In this case, the agents MUST
     NOT attempt to open a new connection (or start new TLS or DTLS-SRTP
     procedures).  Instead, that existing connection is reused, and STUN
     checks are performed.
