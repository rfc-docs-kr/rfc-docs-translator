          When routing a packet between two non-backbone areas the
          backbone is used.  The path that the packet will travel can be
          broken up into three contiguous pieces: an intra-area path from
          the source to an area border router, a backbone path between the
          source and destination areas, and then another intra-area path
          to the destination.  The algorithm finds the set of such paths
          that have the smallest cost.
