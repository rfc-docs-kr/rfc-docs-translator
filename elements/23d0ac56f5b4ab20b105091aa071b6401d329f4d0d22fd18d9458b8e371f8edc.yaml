     A publicly-referenced SMTP server MUST NOT require use of the
     STARTTLS extension in order to deliver mail locally.  This rule
     prevents the STARTTLS extension from damaging the interoperability of
     the Internet's SMTP infrastructure.  A publicly-referenced SMTP
     server is an SMTP server which runs on port 25 of an Internet host
     listed in the MX record (or A record if an MX record is not present)
     for the domain name on the right hand side of an Internet mail
     address.
