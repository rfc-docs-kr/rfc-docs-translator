     In this subsection, we provide a set of common guidelines, in the
     form of what we will refer to as a content catalog for different
     scenarios.  This catalog, which is based on previously published
     work, can be used to evaluate different ICN proposals, for instance,
     on routing, congestion control, and performance, and can be
     considered as other kinds of ICN contributions emerge.  As we are
     still lacking ICN-specific traffic workloads, we can currently only
     extrapolate from today's workloads.  A significant challenge then
     relates to the identification of the applications contributing to the
     observed traffic (e.g., Web or peer-to-peer), as well as to the exact
     amount of traffic they contribute to the overall traffic mixture.
     Efforts in this direction can take heed of today's traffic mix
     comprising Web, peer-to-peer file sharing, and User-Generated Content
     (UGC) platforms (e.g., YouTube), as well as Video on Demand (VoD)
     services.  Publicly available traces for these include those from web
     sites such as the MultiProbe Framework
     <http://multiprobe.ewi.tudelft.nl/multiprobe.html>,
     <http://an.kaist.ac.kr/traces/IMC2007.html> (see also [Cha07]), and
     the UMass Trace Repository
     <http://traces.cs.umass.edu/index.php/Network/Network>.
