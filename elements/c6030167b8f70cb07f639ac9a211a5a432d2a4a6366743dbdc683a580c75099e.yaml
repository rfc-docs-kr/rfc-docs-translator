     Each node specified in a subtree filter represents an inclusive
     filter.  Only associated nodes in underlying data model(s) within the
     specified datastore on the server are selected by the filter.  A node
     is selected if it matches the selection criteria and hierarchy of
     elements given in the filter data, except that the filter absolute
     path name is adjusted to start from the layer below <filter>.
