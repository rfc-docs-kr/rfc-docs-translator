     STARTTLS is a valid ESMTP extension when used on the Submission port,
     as defined in [RFC2476].  In fact, since the submission port is by
     definition not a publicly referenced SMTP server, the STARTTLS
     extension can be particularly useful by providing security and
     authentication for this service.
