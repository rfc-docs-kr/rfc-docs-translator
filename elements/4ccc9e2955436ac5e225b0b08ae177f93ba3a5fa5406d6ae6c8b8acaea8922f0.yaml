     This scenario shows example M3UA message flows for the establishment
     of traffic between an SGP and two ASPs in the same Application
     Server, where ASP1 is configured to be in the ASP-ACTIVE state and
     ASP2 is to be a "backup" in the event of communication failure or the
     withdrawal from service of ASP1.  ASP2 may act as a hot, warm, or
     cold backup, depending on the extent to which ASP1 and ASP2 share
     call/transaction state or can communicate call state under
     failure/withdrawal events.  The example message flow is the same
     whether the ASP Active messages indicate "Override", "Loadshare", or
     "Broadcast" mode, although typically this example would use an
     Override mode.
