     If a server encounters multiple errors during the processing of an
     <rpc> request, the <rpc-reply> MAY contain multiple <rpc-error>
     elements.  However, a server is not required to detect or report more
     than one <rpc-error> element, if a request contains multiple errors.
     A server is not required to check for particular error conditions in
     a specific sequence.  A server MUST return an <rpc-error> element if
     any error conditions occur during processing.
