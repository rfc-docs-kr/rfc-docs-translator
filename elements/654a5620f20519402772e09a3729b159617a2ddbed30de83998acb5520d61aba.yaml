     For byte ranges, a sender SHOULD indicate the complete length of the
     representation from which the range has been extracted, unless the
     complete length is unknown or difficult to determine.  An asterisk
     character ("*") in place of the complete-length indicates that the
     representation length was unknown when the header field was
     generated.

  바이트 범위의 경우 전체 길이를 알 수 없거나 결정하기 어려운 경우를 제외하고 발신자는 범위가 추출된 표현의 전체 길이를 표시해야 합니다. 전체 길이 대신 별표 문자("*")는 헤더 필드가 생성될 때 표현 길이를 알 수 없음을 나타냅니다.
