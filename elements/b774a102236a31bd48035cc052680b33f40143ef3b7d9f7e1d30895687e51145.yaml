          It may be the case the router no longer wishes to originate the
          received LSA. Possible examples include: 1) the LSA is a
          summary-LSA or AS-external-LSA and the router no longer has an
          (advertisable) route to the destination, 2) the LSA is a
          network-LSA but the router is no longer Designated Router for
          the network or 3) the LSA is a network-LSA whose Link State ID
          is one of the router's own IP interface addresses but whose
          Advertising Router is not equal to the router's own Router ID
          (this latter case should be rare, and it indicates that the
          router's Router ID has changed since originating the LSA).  In
          all these cases, instead of updating the LSA, the LSA should be
          flushed from the routing domain by incrementing the received
          LSA's LS age to MaxAge and reflooding (see Section 14.1).
