     What may not be clear from the name is that an Algorithmic Drop
     action often does not drop traffic.  Algorithms other than "always
     drop" normally drop a few percent of packets at most.  The action
     inspects the diffServQEntry that diffServAlgDropQMeasure points to in
     order to determine whether the packet should be dropped.
