     In many of these tables, a distinction is drawn between the structure
     of the policy (do this, then do that) and the parameters applied to
     specific policy elements.  This is to facilitate configuration, if
     the MIB is used for that.  The concept is that a set of parameters,
     such as the values that describe a specific token bucket, might be
     configured once and applied to many interfaces.
