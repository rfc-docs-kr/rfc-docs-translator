     One author of this document was also the author of RFC 2595, which
     became the standard for TLS usage with POP and IMAP, and the other
     author was perhaps the first to propose that idea.  In hindsight,
     both authors now believe that that approach was a mistake.  At this
     point, the authors believe that while anything that makes it easier
     to deploy TLS is good, the desirable end state is that these
     protocols always use TLS, leaving no need for a separate port for
     cleartext operation except to support legacy clients while they
     continue to be used.  The separate-port model for TLS is inherently
     simpler to implement, debug, and deploy.  It also enables a "generic
     TLS load-balancer" that accepts secure client connections for
     arbitrary foo-over-TLS protocols and forwards them to a server that
     may or may not support TLS.  Such load-balancers cause many problems
     because they violate the end-to-end principle and the server loses
     the ability to log security-relevant information about the client
     unless the protocol is designed to forward that information (as this
     specification does for the ciphersuite).  However, they can result in
     TLS deployment where it would not otherwise happen, which is a
     sufficiently important goal that it overrides any problems.
