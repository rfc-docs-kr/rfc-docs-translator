          Each key is identified by the combination of interface and Key
          ID. An interface may have multiple keys active at any one time.
          This enables smooth transition from one key to another. Each key
          has four time constants associated with it. These time constants
          can be expressed in terms of a time-of-day clock, or in terms of
          a router's local clock (e.g., number of seconds since last
          reboot):
