     The Accounting-Record-Number AVP (AVP Code 485) is of type Unsigned32
     and identifies this record within one session.  As Session-Id AVPs
     are globally unique, the combination of Session-Id and Accounting-
     Record-Number AVPs is also globally unique and can be used in
     matching accounting records with confirmations.  An easy way to
     produce unique numbers is to set the value to 0 for records of type
     EVENT_RECORD and START_RECORD and set the value to 1 for the first
     INTERIM_RECORD, 2 for the second, and so on until the value for
     STOP_RECORD is one more than for the last INTERIM_RECORD.
