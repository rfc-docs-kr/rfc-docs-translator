     To reduce the dependency on external CAs, this document specifies a
     limited delegation mechanism that allows a (D)TLS peer to issue its
     own credentials within the scope of a certificate issued by an
     external CA.  These credentials only enable the recipient of the
     delegation to terminate connections for names that the CA has
     authorized.  Furthermore, this mechanism allows the server to use
     modern signature algorithms such as Ed25519 [RFC8032] even if their
     CA does not support them.
