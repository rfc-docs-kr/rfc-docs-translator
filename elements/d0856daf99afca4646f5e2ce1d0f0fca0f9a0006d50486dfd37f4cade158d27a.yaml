           While not necessary for supporting IP and ARP, all
           implementations are required to support IEEE 802.2 standard
           Class I service.  This requires supporting Unnumbered
           Information (UI) Commands, eXchange IDentification (XID)
           Commands and Responses, and TEST link (TEST) Commands and
           Responses.
