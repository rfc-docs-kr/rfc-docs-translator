     Besides the traffic and systems metrics that aim to evaluate an
     approach as a whole, all surveyed approaches also evaluate the
     performance of individual components.  Name resolution, request/data
     routing, and data caching are the most typical components, as
     summarized in Table 5.  Forwarding Information Base (FIB) size and
     path length, i.e., the routing component metrics, are almost
     ubiquitous among approaches, perhaps due to the networking background
     of the involved researchers.  That might be also the reason for the
     sometimes decreased focus on traffic and system metrics, in favor of
     component metrics.  It can certainly be argued that traffic and
     system metrics are affected by component metrics; however, no
     approach has made the relationship clear.  With this in mind and
     taking into account that traffic and system metrics are readily
     useful to end users and network operators, we will restrict ourselves
     to those in the following subsections.
