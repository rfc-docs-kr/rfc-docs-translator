     Queue Table entries are pointed at by the "next" attributes of the
     upstream elements, such as diffServMeterSucceedNext or
     diffServActionNext.  Note that multiple upstream elements may direct
     their traffic to the same Queue Table entry.  For example, the
     Assured Forwarding PHB suggests that all traffic marked AF11, AF12 or
     AF13 be placed in the same queue, after metering, without reordering.
     To accomplish that, the upstream diffServAlgDropNext pointers each
     point to the same diffServQEntry.
