     CDNs.  Taking advantage of the different traffic peak times, a CDN
     may interconnect with another CDN to increase its effective capacity
     during the peak of traffic.  This brings dimensioning savings to the
     CDNs, as they can use each other's resources during their respective
     peaks of activity.

  CDN. 다양한 트래픽 피크 시간을 활용하여 CDN은 다른 CDN과 상호 연결하여 트래픽 피크 동안 유효 용량을 늘릴 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 CDN은 각각의 활동이 최고조에 달하는 동안 서로의 리소스를 사용할 수 있으므로 CDN의 규모를 절감할 수 있습니다.
