          The various states that router interfaces may attain is
          documented in this section.  The states are listed in order of
          progressing functionality.  For example, the inoperative state
          is listed first, followed by a list of intermediate states
          before the final, fully functional state is achieved.  The
          specification makes use of this ordering by sometimes making
          references such as "those interfaces in state greater than X".
          Figure 11 shows the graph of interface state changes.  The arcs
          of the graph are labelled with the event causing the state
          change.  These events are documented in Section 9.2.  The
          interface state machine is described in more detail in Section
          9.3.
