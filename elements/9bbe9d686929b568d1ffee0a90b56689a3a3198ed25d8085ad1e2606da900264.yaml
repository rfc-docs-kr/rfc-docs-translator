        2.   A routing domain which performs summarization of multiple
             routes must discard packets which match the summarization but
             do not match any of the explicit routes which makes up the
             summarization. This is necessary to prevent routing loops in
             the presence of less-specific information (such as a default
             route).  Implementation note - one simple way to implement
             this rule would be for the border router to maintain a "sink"
             route for each of its aggregations. By the rule of longest
             match, this would cause all traffic destined to components of
             the aggregation which are not explicitly known to be
             discarded.
