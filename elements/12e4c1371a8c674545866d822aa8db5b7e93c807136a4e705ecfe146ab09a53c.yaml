     The onramp gateway MAY implement local address mapping mechanisms
     (via a table, directory lookup, or something similar) that permit
     translation from addresses (called "indirect address numbers")
     received from the GSTN fax sending device into e-mail addresses.  A
     single e-mail address or a list of e-mail addresses MAY correspond to
     a single indirect address number.
