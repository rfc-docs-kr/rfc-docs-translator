     The Internet architecture generally provides little protection
     against spoofing of IP source addresses, so any security mechanism
     that is based upon verifying the IP source address of a datagram
     should be treated with suspicion.  However, in restricted
     environments some source-address checking may be possible.  For
     example, there might be a secure LAN whose gateway to the rest of the
     Internet discarded any incoming datagram with a source address that
     spoofed the LAN address.  In this case, a host on the LAN could use
     the source address to test for local vs. remote source.  This problem
     is complicated by source routing, and some have suggested that
     source-routed datagram forwarding by hosts (see Section 3.3.5) should
     be outlawed for security reasons.
