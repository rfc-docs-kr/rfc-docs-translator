          Modifications to this protocol were proposed in [Ref4].  These
          modifications dealt with increasing the fault tolerance of the
          routing protocol through, among other things, adding a checksum
          to the LSAs (thereby detecting database corruption).  The paper
          also included means for reducing the routing traffic overhead in
          a link-state protocol.  This was accomplished by introducing
          mechanisms which enabled the interval between LSA originations
          to be increased by an order of magnitude.
