     Method-specific MICs may be used to provide protection.  If a per-
     packet MIC is employed within an EAP method, then peers,
     authentication servers, and authenticators not operating in pass-
     through mode MUST validate the MIC.  MIC validation failures SHOULD
     be logged.  Whether a MIC validation failure is considered a fatal
     error or not is determined by the EAP method specification.
