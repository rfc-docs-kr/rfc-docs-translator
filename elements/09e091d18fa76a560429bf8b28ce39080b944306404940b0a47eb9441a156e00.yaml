          Case 2: Area A is a transit area and the router is an area
              border router.
              In this case, the following calculations must be performed.
              First, if N's routing table entry presently contains one or
              more inter-area paths that utilize the transit area Area A,
              these paths should be removed. If this removes all paths
              from the routing table entry, the entry should be
              invalidated.  The entry's old values should be saved for
              later comparisons. Next the calculation in Section 16.3 must
              be run again for the single destination N. If the results of
              this calculation have caused the cost to N to increase, the
              complete routing table calculation must be rerun starting
              with the Dijkstra algorithm specified in Section 16.1.
              Otherwise, if the cost/path to an AS boundary router (as
              would be the case for a Type 4 summary-LSA) or to any
              forwarding addresses has changed, all AS-external-LSAs will
