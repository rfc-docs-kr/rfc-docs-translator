     If the agent opened a connection to a TURN server for the purposes of
     gathering a relayed candidate, that connection MUST be kept open by
     the client for the duration of the media session if a relayed
     candidate from the TURN server was selected by ICE.  Otherwise, the
     connection to the TURN server SHOULD be closed once ICE processing
     completes.
