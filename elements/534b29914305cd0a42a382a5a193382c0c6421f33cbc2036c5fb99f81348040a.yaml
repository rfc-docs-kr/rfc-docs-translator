     The default candidate is chosen primarily based on the likelihood of
     it working with a non-ICE peer.  When media streams supporting mixed
     modes (both TCP and UDP) are used with ICE, it is RECOMMENDED that,
     for real-time streams (such as RTP), the default candidates be UDP-
     based.  However, the default SHOULD NOT be a simultaneous-open
     candidate.
