     o  MUAs SHOULD be capable of using DNS SRV records to discover Mail
        Access Servers and Mail Submission Servers that are advertised by
        an MSP for an account being configured.  Other means of
        discovering server configuration information (e.g., a database
        maintained by the MUA vendor) MAY also be supported.  (See
        Section 5.1 for more information.)
