     All ICN architectures considered in this document primarily target
     the validity requirement using strong cryptographic means to tie the
     content request name to the content.  Provenance and relevance are
     directly targeted to varying extents:  There is a tussle or trade-off
     between simplicity and efficiency of access and level of assurance of
     all these traits.  For example, maintaining provenance information
     can become extremely costly, particularly when considering (historic)
     relationships between multiple objects.  Architectural decisions have
     therefore been made in each case as to whether the assessment is
     carried out by the information-centric network or left to the
     application.
