     *  X.509 semantics are very rich.  This can cause unintended
        consequences if a service owner creates a proxy certificate where
        the properties differ from the leaf certificate.  Proxy
        certificates can be useful in controlled environments, but remain
        a risk in scenarios where the additional flexibility they provide
        is not necessary.  For this reason, delegated credentials have
        very restricted semantics that should not conflict with X.509
        semantics.
