        For example, a bridge CA (BCA)                 CA1
        could cross-certify with four                   ^
        PKIs that have the roots CA1,                   |
        CA2, CA3, and CA4. The cross-                   v
        certificates that the roots            CA2 <-> BCA <-> CA3
        exchange with the BCA enable an                 ^
        end entity EE1 certified under                  |
        under CA1 in PK1 to construct                   v
        a certification path needed to                 CA4
        validate the certificate of
        end entity EE2 under CA2,           CA1 -> BCA -> CA2 -> EE2
        or vice versa.                     CA2 -> BCA -> CA1 -> EE1
