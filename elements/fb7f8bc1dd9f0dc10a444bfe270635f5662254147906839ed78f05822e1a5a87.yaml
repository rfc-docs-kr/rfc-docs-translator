     Media Gateway Controllers are typically dimensioned to handle the
     peak hour traffic load, during which, in average, 10% of the lines
     will be busy, placing calls whose average duration is typically 3
     minutes.  The processing of a call typically involves 5 to 6 Media
     Gateway Controller transactions between each Media Gateway and the
     Media Gateway Controller.  This simple calculation shows that the
     Media Gateway Controller is expected to handle 5 to 6 transactions
     for each Termination, every 30 minutes on average, or, to put it
     otherwise, about one transaction per Termination every 5 to 6 minutes
     on average.  This suggests that a reasonable value of MWD for a
     residential gateway would be 10 to 12 minutes.  In the absence of
     explicit configuration, residential gateways should adopt a value of
     600 seconds for MWD.
