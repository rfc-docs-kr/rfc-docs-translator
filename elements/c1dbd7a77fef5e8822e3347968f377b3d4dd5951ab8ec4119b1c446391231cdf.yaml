     o  Deprecated the use of the Inband-Security AVP for negotiating
        Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246].  It has been generally
        considered that bootstrapping of TLS via Inband-Security AVP
        creates certain security risks because it does not completely
        protect the information carried in the CER/CEA (Capabilities-
        Exchange-Request/Capabilities-Exchange-Answer).  This version of
        Diameter adopts the common approach of defining a well-known
        secured port that peers should use when communicating via TLS/TCP
        and DTLS/SCTP.  This new approach augments the existing in-band
        security negotiation, but it does not completely replace it.  The
        old method is kept for backward compatibility reasons.
