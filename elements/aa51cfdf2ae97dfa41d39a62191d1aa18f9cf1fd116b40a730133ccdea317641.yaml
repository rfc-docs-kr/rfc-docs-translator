     Method Type 254 is allocated for the Expanded Type.  Where the
     Vendor-Id field is non-zero, the Expanded Type is used for functions
     specific only to one vendor's implementation of EAP, where no
     interoperability is deemed useful.  When used with a Vendor-Id of
     zero, method Type 254 can also be used to provide for an expanded
     IETF method Type space.  Method Type values 256-4294967295 may be
     allocated after Type values 1-191 have been allocated, on the advice
     of a Designated Expert, with Specification Required.
