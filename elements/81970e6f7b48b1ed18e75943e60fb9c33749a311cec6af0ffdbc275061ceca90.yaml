          Several routing table entries may match the destination address.
          In this case, the "best match" is the routing table entry that
          provides the most specific (longest) match. Another way of
          saying this is to choose the entry that specifies the narrowest
          range of IP addresses.[11] For example, the entry for the
          address/mask pair of (128.185.1.0, 0xffffff00) is more specific
          than an entry for the pair (128.185.0.0, 0xffff0000). The
          default route is the least specific match, since it matches all
          destinations. (Note that for any single routing table entry,
          multiple paths may be possible. In these cases, the calculations
          in Sections 16.1, 16.2, and 16.4 always yield the paths having
          the most preferential path-type, as described in Section 11).
