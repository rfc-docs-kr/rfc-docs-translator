     Where certificate-based authentication is supported, the number of
     additional roundtrips may be much larger due to fragmentation of
     certificate chains.  In general, a fragmented EAP packet will require
     as many round-trips to send as there are fragments.  For example, a
     certificate chain 14960 octets in size would require ten round-trips
     to send with a 1496 octet EAP MTU.
