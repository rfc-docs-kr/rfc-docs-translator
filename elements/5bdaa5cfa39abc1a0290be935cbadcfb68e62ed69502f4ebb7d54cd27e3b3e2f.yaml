        A fourth solution involves assignment of a particular address
        prefix for routing domains which are attached to precisely two (or
        more) specific routing domains. For example, suppose that there
        are two providers "SouthNorthNet" and "NorthSouthNet" which have a
        very large number of customers in common (i.e., there are a large
        number of routing domains which are attached to both). Rather than
        getting two address prefixes these organizations could obtain
        three prefixes.  Those routing domains which are attached to
        NorthSouthNet but not attached to SouthNorthNet obtain an address
        assignment based on one of the prefixes. Those routing domains
        which are attached to SouthNorthNet but not to NorthSouthNet would
        obtain an address based on the second prefix. Finally, those
        routing domains which are multi-homed to both of these networks
        would obtain an address based on the third prefix.  Each of these
        two TRDs would then advertise two prefixes to other TRDs, one
        prefix for leaf routing domains attached to it only, and one
        prefix for leaf routing domains attached to both.
