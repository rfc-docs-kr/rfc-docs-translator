     In general, only generation of duplicates due to failover or re-
     sending of records in non-volatile storage can be reliably detected
     by Diameter clients or agents.  In such cases, the Diameter client or
     agents can mark the message as a possible duplicate by setting the T
     flag.  Since the Diameter server is responsible for duplicate
     detection, it can choose whether or not to make use of the T flag, in
     order to optimize duplicate detection.  Since the T flag does not
     affect interoperability, and it may not be needed by some servers,
     generation of the T flag is REQUIRED for Diameter clients and agents,
     but it MAY be implemented by Diameter servers.
