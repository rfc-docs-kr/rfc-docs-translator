     M-ASP_UP, M-ASP_DOWN, M-ASP_ACTIVE, and M-ASP_INACTIVE request
     primitives allow Layer Management at an ASP to initiate state
     changes.  Upon successful completion, a corresponding confirm
     primitive is provided by the M3UA layer to Layer Management.  If an
     invocation is unsuccessful, an Error indication primitive is provided
     in the primitive.  These requests result in outgoing ASP Up, ASP
     Down, ASP Active, and ASP Inactive messages to the remote M3UA peer
     at an SGP or IPSP.
