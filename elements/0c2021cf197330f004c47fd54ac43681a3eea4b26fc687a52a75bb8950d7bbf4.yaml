     There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
     information that may be sensitive from a business perspective, in
     that they may represent a customer's service contract or the filters
     that the service provider chooses to apply to a customer's ingress or
     egress traffic.  There are no objects which are sensitive in their
     own right, such as passwords or monetary amounts.
