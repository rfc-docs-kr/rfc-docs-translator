     When there is no Routing Key match, or only a partial match, for an
     incoming SS7 message, a default treatment MAY be specified.  Possible
     solutions are to provide a default Application Server at the SGP that
     directs all unallocated traffic to a (set of) default ASP(s), or to
     drop the message and provide a notification to Layer Management in an
     M-ERROR indication primitive.  The treatment of unallocated traffic
     is implementation dependent.
