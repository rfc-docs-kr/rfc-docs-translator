              A TCP MUST be able to receive a TCP option in any segment.
              A TCP MUST ignore without error any TCP option it does not
              implement, assuming that the option has a length field (all
              TCP options defined in the future will have length fields).
              TCP MUST be prepared to handle an illegal option length
              (e.g., zero) without crashing; a suggested procedure is to
              reset the connection and log the reason.
