     An established connection is said to be "half-open" if one of the TCP
     peers has closed or aborted the connection at its end without the
     knowledge of the other, or if the two ends of the connection have
     become desynchronized owing to a failure or reboot that resulted in
     loss of memory.  Such connections will automatically become reset if
     an attempt is made to send data in either direction.  However, half-
     open connections are expected to be unusual.

  TCP 피어 중 하나가 다른 쪽도 모르게 연결을 닫거나 중단한 경우, 또는 연결의 두 끝이 실패로 인해 동기화되지 않은 경우 설정된 연결을 "반개방"이라고 합니다. 재부팅으로 인해 메모리가 손실되었습니다. 이러한 연결은 어느 방향으로든 데이터를 전송하려고 시도하면 자동으로 재설정됩니다. 그러나 반개방 연결은 이례적일 것으로 예상됩니다.
