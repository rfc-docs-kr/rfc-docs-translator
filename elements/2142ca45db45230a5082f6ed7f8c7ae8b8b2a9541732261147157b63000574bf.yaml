     The HMAC field in TWAMP-Test packets covers the same fields as the
     Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption.  Thus, in
     authenticated mode, HMAC covers the first block (16 octets); in
     encrypted mode, HMAC covers the first six blocks (96 octets).  In
     TWAMP-Test, the HMAC field MUST NOT be encrypted.
