          The area border routers RT3, RT4, RT7, RT10 and RT11 condense
          the routing information of their attached non-backbone areas for
          distribution via the backbone; these are the dashed stubs that
          appear in Figure 8.  Remember that the third area has been
          configured to condense Networks N9-N11 and Host H1 into a single
          route.  This yields a single dashed line for networks N9-N11 and
          Host H1 in Figure 8.  Routers RT5 and RT7 are AS boundary
          routers; their externally derived information also appears on
          the graph in Figure 8 as stubs.
