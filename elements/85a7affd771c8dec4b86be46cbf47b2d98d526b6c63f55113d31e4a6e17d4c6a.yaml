        For example, suppose that a given site is trying to decide whether
        to obtain an IP address prefix directly from the IP address space
        allocated for North America, or from the IP address space
        allocated to its service provider. If considering only their own
        self-interest, the site itself and the attached provider have
        little reason to choose one approach or the other. The site must
        use one prefix or another; the source of the prefix has little
        effect on routing efficiency within the site. The provider must
        maintain information about each attached site in order to route,
        regardless of any commonality in the prefixes of the sites.
