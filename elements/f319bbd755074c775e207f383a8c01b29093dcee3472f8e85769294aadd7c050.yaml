     The Diameter base protocol messages SHOULD be secured by using TLS
     [RFC5246] or DTLS/SCTP [RFC6083].  Additional security mechanisms
     such as IPsec [RFC4301] MAY also be deployed to secure connections
     between peers.  However, all Diameter base protocol implementations
     MUST support the use of TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP, and the Diameter
     protocol MUST NOT be used without one of TLS, DTLS, or IPsec.
