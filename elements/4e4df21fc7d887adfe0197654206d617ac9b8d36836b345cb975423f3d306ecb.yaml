           A host SHOULD support local IP multicasting on all connected
           networks for which a mapping from Class D IP addresses to
           link-layer addresses has been specified (see below).  Support
           for local IP multicasting includes sending multicast datagrams,
           joining multicast groups and receiving multicast datagrams, and
           leaving multicast groups.  This implies support for all of
           [IP:4] except the IGMP protocol itself, which is OPTIONAL.
