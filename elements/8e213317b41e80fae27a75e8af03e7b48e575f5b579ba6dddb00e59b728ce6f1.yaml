     For internal SGP modeling purposes, this may be accomplished with the
     use of an implementation-dependent nodal interworking function within
     the SGP that effectively sits below the SCCP and routes MTP-TRANSFER
     request/indication messages to/from both the MTP3 and the M3UA layer,
     based on the SS7 DPC or DPC/SI address information.  This nodal
     interworking function has no visible peer protocol with either the
     ASP or SEP.
