     Because the registry may only contain sixteen values, and because
     OWAMP and TWAMP are IETF protocols, this registry must only be
     updated by "IETF Consensus" as specified in [RFC5226] -- an RFC
     documenting the use that is approved by the IESG.  We expect that new
     values will be assigned as monotonically increasing integers in the
     range [0-15], unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.
