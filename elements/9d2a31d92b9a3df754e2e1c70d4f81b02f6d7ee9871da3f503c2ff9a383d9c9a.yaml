        (a)  certificate:  The algorithm requires the certificate serial
             number and issuer name to determine whether a certificate is
             on a particular CRL.  The basicConstraints extension is used
             to determine whether the supplied certificate is associated
             with a CA or an end entity.  If present, the algorithm uses
             the cRLDistributionPoints and freshestCRL extensions to
             determine revocation status.
