     Typically, of course, a classifier identifies a variety of traffic
     and breaks it up into separate classes.  It might very well contain
     fourteen classifier elements indicating the twelve AFmn DSCP values,
     EF, and "everything else".  These would presumably direct traffic
     down six functional data paths: one for each AF or EF class, and one
     for all other traffic.
