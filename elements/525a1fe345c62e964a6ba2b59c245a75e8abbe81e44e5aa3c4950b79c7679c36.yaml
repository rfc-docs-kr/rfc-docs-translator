        The Type-Data field contains the OTP "challenge" as a displayable
        message in the Request.  In the Response, this field is used for
        the 6 words from the OTP dictionary [RFC2289].  The messages MUST
        NOT be null terminated.  The length of the field is derived from
        the Length field of the Request/Reply packet.
