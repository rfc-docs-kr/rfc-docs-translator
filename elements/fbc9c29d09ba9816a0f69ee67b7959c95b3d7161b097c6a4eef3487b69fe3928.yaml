                   Another important TCP performance issue is that some
                   applications, especially remote login to character-at-
                   a-time hosts, tend to send streams of one-octet data
                   segments.  To avoid deadlocks, every TCP SEND call from
                   such applications must be "pushed", either explicitly
                   by the application or else implicitly by TCP.  The
                   result may be a stream of TCP segments that contain one
                   data octet each, which makes very inefficient use of
                   the Internet and contributes to Internet congestion.
                   The Nagle Algorithm described in Section 4.2.3.4
                   provides a simple and effective solution to this
                   problem.  It does have the effect of clumping
