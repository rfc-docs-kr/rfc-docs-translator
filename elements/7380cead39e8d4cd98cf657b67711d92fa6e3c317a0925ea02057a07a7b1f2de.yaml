     Traditional NAT would allow hosts within a private network to
     transparently access hosts in the external network, in most cases.
     In a traditional NAT, sessions are uni-directional, outbound from the
     private network. This is in contrast with Bi-directional NAT, which
     permits sessions in both inbound and outbound directions. A detailed
     description of Bi-directional NAT may be found in section 4.2.
