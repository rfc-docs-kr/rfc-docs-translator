     If an SGP determines that a received Routing Key does not currently
     exist and that the SGP supports dynamic configuration but does not
     have the capacity to add new Routing Key and Application Server
     entries, the SGP returns a Registration Response message to the ASP,
     containing a Registration Result "Error - Insufficient Resources".
