              OSPF runs in one of two modes over non-broadcast networks.
              The first mode, called non-broadcast multi-access or NBMA,
              simulates the operation of OSPF on a broadcast network. The
              second mode, called Point-to-MultiPoint, treats the non-
              broadcast network as a collection of point-to-point links.
              Non-broadcast networks are referred to as NBMA networks or
              Point-to-MultiPoint networks, depending on OSPF's mode of
              operation over the network.
