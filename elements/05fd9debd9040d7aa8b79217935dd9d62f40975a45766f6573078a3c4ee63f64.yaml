              DISCUSSION:
                   The choice of TCP segment size has a strong effect on
                   performance.  Larger segments increase throughput by
                   amortizing header size and per-datagram processing
                   overhead over more data bytes; however, if the packet
                   is so large that it causes IP fragmentation, efficiency
                   drops sharply if any fragments are lost [IP:9].
