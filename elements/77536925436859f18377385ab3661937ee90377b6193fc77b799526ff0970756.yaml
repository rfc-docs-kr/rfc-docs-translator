     The application layer MUST be able to specify the Differentiated
     Services field for segments that are sent on a connection (MUST-48).
     The Differentiated Services field includes the 6-bit Differentiated
     Services Codepoint (DSCP) value.  It is not required, but the
     application SHOULD be able to change the Differentiated Services
     field during the connection lifetime (SHLD-21).  TCP implementations
     SHOULD pass the current Differentiated Services field value without
     change to the IP layer, when it sends segments on the connection
     (SHLD-22).

  애플리케이션 계층은 연결을 통해 전송되는 세그먼트에 대해 차별화된 서비스 필드를 지정할 수 있어야 합니다(MUST-48). 차별화된 서비스 필드에는 6비트 DSCP(Differentiated Services Codepoint) 값이 포함됩니다. 필수는 아니지만 애플리케이션은 연결 수명 동안 차별화된 서비스 필드를 변경할 수 있어야 합니다(SHLD-21). TCP 구현은 연결(SHLD-22)에서 세그먼트를 보낼 때 IP 계층에 대한 변경 없이 현재 차별화된 서비스 필드 값을 전달해야 합니다(SHOULD).
