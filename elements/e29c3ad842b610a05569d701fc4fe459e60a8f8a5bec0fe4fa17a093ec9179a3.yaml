                   A higher-layer protocol may want to set the TTL in
                   order to implement an "expanding scope" search for some
                   Internet resource.  This is used by some diagnostic
                   tools, and is expected to be useful for locating the
                   "nearest" server of a given class using IP
                   multicasting, for example.  A particular transport
                   protocol may also want to specify its own TTL bound on
                   maximum datagram lifetime.
