     Address binding is the phase in which a local node IP address is
     associated with an external address or vice versa, for purposes of
     translation. Address binding is fixed with static address assignments
     and is dynamic at session startup time with dynamic address
     assignments. Once the binding between two addresses is in place, all
     subsequent sessions originating from or to this host will use the
     same binding for session based packet translation.
