     A stateful proxy responds to a CANCEL, rather than simply forwarding
     a response it would receive from a downstream element.  For that
     reason, CANCEL is referred to as a "hop-by-hop" request, since it is
     responded to at each stateful proxy hop.

  상태 저장 프록시는 단순히 다운스트림 요소로부터 수신할 응답을 전달하는 것이 아니라 CANCEL에 응답합니다. 이러한 이유로 CANCEL은 각 상태 저장 프록시 홉에서 응답되므로 "홉별" 요청이라고 합니다.
