     Signalling Gateways may also be distributed over multiple hosts.
     Much like the AS model, SGs may comprise one or more SG Processes
     (SGPs), distributed over one or more hosts, using an active/backup or
     a loadsharing model.  Should an SGP lose all or partial SS7
     connectivity and other SGPs exist, the SGP may terminate the SCTP
     associations to the concerned ASPs.
