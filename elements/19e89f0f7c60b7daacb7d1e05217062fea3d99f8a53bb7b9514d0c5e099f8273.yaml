     Local management MAY request from the M3UA layer the status of the
     underlying SCTP associations using the M-SCTP_STATUS request and
     confirm primitives.  Also, the M3UA MAY autonomously inform local
     management of the reason for the release of an SCTP association,
     determined either locally within the M3UA layer or by a primitive
     from the SCTP.
