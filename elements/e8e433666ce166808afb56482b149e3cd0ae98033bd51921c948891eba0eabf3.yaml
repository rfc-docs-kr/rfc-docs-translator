     A legacy TLS client performing renegotiation with TLS 1.2 or prior
     and which receives a TLS 1.3 ServerHello during renegotiation MUST
     abort the handshake with a "protocol_version" alert.  Note that
     renegotiation is not possible when TLS 1.3 has been negotiated.

  TLS 1.2 이하 버전으로 재협상을 수행하고 재협상 중에 TLS 1.3 ServerHello를 수신하는 레거시 TLS 클라이언트는 "protocol_version" 경고와 함께 핸드셰이크를 중단해야 합니다. TLS 1.3이 협상되면 재협상이 불가능합니다.
