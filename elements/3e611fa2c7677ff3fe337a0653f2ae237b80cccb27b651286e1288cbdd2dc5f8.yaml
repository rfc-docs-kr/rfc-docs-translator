     The Inband-Security-Id AVP (AVP Code 299) is of type Unsigned32 and
     is used in order to advertise support of the security portion of the
     application.  The use of this AVP in CER and CEA messages is NOT
     RECOMMENDED.  Instead, discovery of a Diameter entity's security
     capabilities can be done either through static configuration or via
     Diameter Peer Discovery as described in Section 5.2.
