        The accounting message will carry the Application Id of the
        Diameter base accounting application (see Section 2.4).
        Accounting messages may be routed to Diameter nodes other than the
        corresponding Diameter application.  These nodes might be
        centralized accounting servers that provide accounting service for
        multiple different Diameter applications.  These nodes MUST
        advertise the Diameter base accounting Application Id during
        capabilities exchange.
