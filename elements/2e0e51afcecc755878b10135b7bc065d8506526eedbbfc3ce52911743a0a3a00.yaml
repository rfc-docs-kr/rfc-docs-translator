              DISCUSSION:
                   Note that ICMP error messages resulting from sending a
                   UDP datagram are received asynchronously.  A UDP-based
                   application that wants to receive ICMP error messages
                   is responsible for maintaining the state necessary to
                   demultiplex these messages when they arrive; for
                   example, the application may keep a pending receive
                   operation for this purpose.  The application is also
                   responsible to avoid confusion from a delayed ICMP
                   error message resulting from an earlier use of the same
                   port(s).
