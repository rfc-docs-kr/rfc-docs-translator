                      sequence number in the neighbor data structure.  If
                      this is the first time that an adjacency has been
                      attempted, the DD sequence number should be assigned
                      some unique value (like the time of day clock).  It
                      then declares itself master (sets the master/slave
                      bit to master), and starts sending Database
                      Description Packets, with the initialize (I), more
                      (M) and master (MS) bits set.  This Database
                      Description Packet should be otherwise empty.  This
                      Database Description Packet should be retransmitted
                      at intervals of RxmtInterval until the next state is
                      entered (see Section 10.8).
