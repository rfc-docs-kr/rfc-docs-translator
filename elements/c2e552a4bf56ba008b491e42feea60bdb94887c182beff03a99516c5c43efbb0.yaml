          Premature aging can also be used when, for example, one of the
          router's previously advertised external routes is no longer
          reachable.  In this circumstance, the router can flush its AS-
          external-LSA from the routing domain via premature aging. This
          procedure is preferable to the alternative, which is to
          originate a new LSA for the destination specifying a metric of
          LSInfinity.  Premature aging is also be used when unexpectedly
          receiving self-originated LSAs during the flooding procedure
          (see Section 13.4).
