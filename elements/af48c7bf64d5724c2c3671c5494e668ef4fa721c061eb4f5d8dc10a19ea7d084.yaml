     The Statistics parameter provides information describing the status
     and usage of a Termination during its existence within a specific
     Context.  There is a set of standard statistics kept for each
     termination where appropriate (number of octets sent and received for
     example).  The particular statistical properties that are reported
     for a given Termination are determined by the Packages realized by
     the Termination.  By default, statistics are reported when the
     Termination is Subtracted from the Context.  This behavior can be
     overridden by including an empty AuditDescriptor in the Subtract
     command.  Statistics may also be returned from the AuditValue
     command, or any Add/Move/Modify command using the Audit descriptor.
     Statistics are cumulative; reporting Statistics does not reset them.
     Statistics are reset when a Termination is Subtracted from a Context.
