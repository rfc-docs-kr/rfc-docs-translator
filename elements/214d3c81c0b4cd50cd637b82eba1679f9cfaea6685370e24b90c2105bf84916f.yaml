     *  Proxy certificates rely on the certificate path building process
        to establish a binding between the proxy certificate and the end-
        entity certificate.  Since the certificate path building process
        is not cryptographically protected, it is possible that a proxy
        certificate could be bound to another certificate with the same
        public key, with different X.509 parameters.  Delegated
        credentials, which rely on a cryptographic binding between the
        entire certificate and the delegated credential, cannot.
