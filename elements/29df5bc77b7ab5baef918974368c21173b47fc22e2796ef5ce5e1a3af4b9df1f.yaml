              If the newly added vertex is an area border router or AS
              boundary router, a routing table entry is added whose
              destination type is "router".  The Options field found in
              the associated router-LSA is copied into the routing table
              entry's Optional capabilities field. Call the newly added
              vertex Router X.  If Router X is the endpoint of one of the
              calculating router's virtual links, and the virtual link
              uses Area A as Transit area:  the virtual link is declared
              up, the IP address of the virtual interface is set to the IP
              address of the outgoing interface calculated above for
              Router X, and the virtual neighbor's IP address is set to
              Router X's interface address (contained in Router X's
              router-LSA) that points back to the root of the shortest-
              path tree; equivalently, this is the interface that points
              back to Router X's parent vertex on the shortest-path tree
              (similar to the calculation in Section 16.1.1).
