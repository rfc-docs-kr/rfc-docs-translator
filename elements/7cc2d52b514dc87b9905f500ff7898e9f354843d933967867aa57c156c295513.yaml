     Note that EAP Success and Failure packets are not retransmitted.
     Without a reliable lower layer, and with a non-negligible error rate,
     these packets can be lost, resulting in timeouts.  It is therefore
     desirable for implementations to improve their resilience to loss of
     EAP Success or Failure packets, as described in Section 4.2.
