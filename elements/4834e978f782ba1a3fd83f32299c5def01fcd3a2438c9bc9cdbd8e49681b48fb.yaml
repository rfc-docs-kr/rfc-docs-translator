          IP multicast
              Certain OSPF packets take the form of IP multicast
              datagrams.  Support for receiving and sending IP multicast
              datagrams, along with the appropriate lower-level protocol
              support, is required.  The IP multicast datagrams used by
              OSPF never travel more than one hop. For this reason, the
              ability to forward IP multicast datagrams is not required.
              For information on IP multicast, see [Ref7].
