              DISCUSSION:
                   The Information Request/Reply pair was intended to
                   support self-configuring systems such as diskless
                   workstations, to allow them to discover their IP
                   network numbers at boot time.  However, the RARP and
                   BOOTP protocols provide better mechanisms for a host to
                   discover its own IP address.
