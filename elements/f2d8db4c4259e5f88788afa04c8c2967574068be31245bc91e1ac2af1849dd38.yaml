     The ObservedEventsDescriptor contains the RequestID and a list of
     events that the Media Gateway detected in the order that they were
     detected. Each event in the list is accompanied by parameters
     associated with the event and an indication of the time that the
     event was detected.  Procedures for sending Notify commands with
     RequestID equal to 0 are for further study.
