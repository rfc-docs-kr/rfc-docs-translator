     It is expected that in the near future the IANA will instruct the
     Internet Registries to begin allocating IP addresses out of the
     former Class A address space (64.0.0.0 through 126.0.0.0). The
     allocated blocks are going to be of variable size (based on the
     actual sites' requirements).  Sites that will use these addresses
     will have to support CIDR-capable routing protocols. All the
     providers will be required to support CIDR-capable routing protocols
     as well. Sites that do not use these addresses would be required to
     continue relying on a default route, which in turn may result in a
     various degree of suboptimal routing. If a site wants to avoid the
     suboptimality (introduced by using default route), the site will need
     to transition to CIDR-capable routing protocols.
