        This situation is roughly analogous to the present dissemination
        of routing information in the Internet, where each domain may have
        non-contiguous network numbers assigned to it.  The result of
        allowing subnetworks within a routing domain to take their IP
        addresses from unrelated IP address spaces is flat routing at the
        A/B/C class network level.  The number of IP prefixes that leaf
        routing domains would advertise is on the order of the number of
        attached network numbers; the number of prefixes a provider's
        routing domain would advertise is approximately the number of
        network numbers attached to the client leaf routing domains; and
        for a backbone this would be summed across all attached providers.
        This situation is just barely acceptable in the current Internet,
        and as the Internet grows this will quickly become intractable. A
        greater degree of hierarchical information reduction is necessary
        to allow continued growth in the Internet.
