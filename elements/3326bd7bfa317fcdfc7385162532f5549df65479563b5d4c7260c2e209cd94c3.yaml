        IEEE 802.5 networks support three different types of broadcasts.
        All-Stations broadcasts are sent with no RIF or with the Broadcast
        Indicators set to 0 and no Routing Designators, and are copied
        once by all stations on the local ring.  All-Routes broadcasts are
        sent with the corresponding Broadcast Indicators and result in
        multiple copies equal to the number of distinct non-repeating
        routes a packet may follow to a particular ring.  Single-Route
        broadcasts result in exactly one copy of a frame being received by
        all stations on the multi-ring network.
