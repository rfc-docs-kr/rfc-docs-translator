     This memo defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7
     MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the
     services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol [18].  Also,
     provision is made for protocol elements that enable a seamless
     operation of the MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains.  This
     protocol would be used between a Signalling Gateway (SG) and a Media
     Gateway Controller (MGC) or IP-resident Database [12], or between two
     IP-based applications.
