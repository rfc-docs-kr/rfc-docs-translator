     *  Each delegated credential is bound to a specific signature
        algorithm for use in the (D)TLS handshake ([RFC8446],
        Section 4.2.3).  This prevents them from being used with other,
        perhaps unintended, signature algorithms.  The signature algorithm
        bound to the delegated credential can be chosen independently of
        the set of signature algorithms supported by the end-entity
        certificate.
