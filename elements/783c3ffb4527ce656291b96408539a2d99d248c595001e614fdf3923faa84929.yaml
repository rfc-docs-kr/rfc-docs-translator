              For example, consider a valid_policy_tree with a node of
              depth i-1 where the valid_policy is anyPolicy.  Assume the
              certificate policies Gold and Silver appear in the
              certificate policies extension of certificate i.  The Gold
              policy does not have a qualifier, but the Silver policy has
              the qualifier Q-Silver.  If Gold and Silver were not matched
              in (i) above, this rule will generate two child nodes of
              depth i, one for each policy.  The result is shown as Figure
              5.
