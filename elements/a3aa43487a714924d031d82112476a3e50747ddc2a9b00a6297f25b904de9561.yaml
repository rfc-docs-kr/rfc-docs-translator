     The request has succeeded, and no request attributes were substituted
     or ignored.  In the case of a response to a Job Creation request, the
     'successful-ok' status-code indicates that the request was
     successfully received and validated, and that the Job object has been
     created; it does not indicate that the Job has been processed.  The
     transition of the Job object into the 'completed' state is the only
     indicator that the Job has been printed.

  요청이 성공했으며 요청 속성이 대체되거나 무시되지 않았습니다. 작업 생성 요청에 대한 응답의 경우 'successful-ok' 상태 코드는 요청이 성공적으로 수신 및 검증되었으며 작업 개체가 생성되었음을 나타냅니다. 작업이 처리되었음을 나타내지는 않습니다. 작업 개체가 '완료' 상태로 전환되는 것은 작업이 인쇄되었음을 나타내는 유일한 표시입니다.
