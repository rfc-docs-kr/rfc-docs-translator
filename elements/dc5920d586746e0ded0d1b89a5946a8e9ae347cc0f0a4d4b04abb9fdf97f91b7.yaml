        The Request packet (Code field set to 1) is sent by the
        authenticator to the peer.  Each Request has a Type field which
        serves to indicate what is being requested.  Additional Request
        packets MUST be sent until a valid Response packet is received, an
        optional retry counter expires, or a lower layer failure
        indication is received.
