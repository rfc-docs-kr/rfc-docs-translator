     min-fresh      Indicates that the client is willing to accept a
                    server response with cached data whose expiration is
                    no less than its current age plus the specified time
                    in seconds.  If the server's cache time-to-live
                    exceeds the client-supplied min-fresh value, the
                    server MUST NOT utilize cached content.
