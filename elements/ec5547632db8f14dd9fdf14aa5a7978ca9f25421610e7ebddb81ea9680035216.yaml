     Two meter entries are used to configure this, one for the conforming
     rate and one for the excess rate.  The rate parameters are stored in
     associated Token Bucket Parameter Entries.  The "FailNext" pointer of
     the lower rate Meter Entry points to the other Meter Entry; both
     "SucceedNext" pointers and the "FailNext" pointer of the higher Meter
     Entry point to lists of actions.  In the color-blind mode, all three
     classifier "next" entries point to the lower rate meter entry.  In
     the color-aware mode, the AFm1 classifier points to the lower rate
     entry, the AFm2 classifier points to the higher rate entry (as it is
     only compared against that rate), and the AFm3 classifier points
     directly to the actions taken when both rates fail.
