     For registrations made from documents on the Standards Track, there
     is often expert review required (by the registration policy) in
     addition to IETF consensus (for approval as a Standards Track RFC).
     In such cases, the review by the designated expert needs to be
     timely, submitted before the IESG evaluates the document.  The IESG
     should generally not hold the document up waiting for a late review.
     It is also not intended for the expert review to override IETF
     consensus: the IESG should consider the review in its own evaluation,
     as it would do for other Last Call reviews.

  표준 트랙의 문서에서 등록한 경우 IETF 합의(표준 트랙 RFC 승인을 위해) 외에 등록 정책에 따라 전문가 검토가 필요한 경우가 많습니다. 그러한 경우, 지정된 전문가의 검토는 IESG가 문서를 평가하기 전에 적시에 제출되어야 합니다. IESG는 일반적으로 늦은 검토를 기다리면서 문서를 보류해서는 안 됩니다. 또한 전문가 검토가 IETF 합의를 무시하도록 의도되지 않았습니다. IESG는 다른 Last Call 검토와 마찬가지로 자체 평가에서 검토를 고려해야 합니다.
