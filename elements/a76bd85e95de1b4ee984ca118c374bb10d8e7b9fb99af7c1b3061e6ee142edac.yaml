     For example, EAP-TLS [RFC2716] is a client-server protocol in which
     distinct certificate profiles are typically utilized for the client
     and server.  This implies that a host supporting peer-to-peer
     authentication with EAP-TLS would need to implement both the EAP peer
     and authenticator layers, support both peer and authenticator roles
     in the EAP-TLS implementation, and provision certificates appropriate
     for each role.
