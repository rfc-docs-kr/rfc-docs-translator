     We do not assume, however, that broadcasts are reliably delivered.
     (One might consider providing a reliable broadcast protocol as a
     layer above IP.) It is quite expensive to guarantee delivery of
     broadcasts; instead, what we assume is that a host will receive most
     of the broadcasts that are sent.  This is important to avoid
     excessive use of broadcasts; since every host on the network devotes
     at least some effort to every broadcast, they are costly.
