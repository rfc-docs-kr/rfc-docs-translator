     Each frame and scan is preceded with a header containing optional
     definitions for compression parameters like quantization tables and
     Huffman coding tables.  The headers and optional parameters are
     identified with "markers" and comprise a marker segment; each scan
     appears as an entropy-coded bit stream within two marker segments.
     Markers are aligned to byte boundaries and (in general) cannot appear
     in the entropy-coded segment, allowing scan boundaries to be
     determined without parsing the bit stream.
