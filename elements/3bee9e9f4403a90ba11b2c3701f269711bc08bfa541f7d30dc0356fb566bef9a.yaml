     When a Diameter server authorizes a user to implement network
     resources for a finite amount of time, and it is willing to extend
     the authorization via a future request, it MUST add the
     Authorization- Lifetime AVP to the answer message.  The
     Authorization-Lifetime AVP defines the maximum number of seconds a
     user MAY make use of the resources before another authorization
     request is expected by the server.  The Auth-Grace-Period AVP
     contains the number of seconds following the expiration of the
     Authorization-Lifetime, after which the server will release all state
     information related to the user's session.  Note that if payment for
     services is expected by the serving realm from the user's home realm,
     the Authorization-Lifetime AVP, combined with the Auth-Grace-Period
     AVP, implies the maximum length of the session for which the home
     realm is willing to be fiscally responsible.  Services provided past
     the expiration of the Authorization-Lifetime and Auth-Grace-Period
     AVPs are the responsibility of the access device.  Of course, the
     actual cost of services rendered is clearly outside the scope of the
     protocol.
