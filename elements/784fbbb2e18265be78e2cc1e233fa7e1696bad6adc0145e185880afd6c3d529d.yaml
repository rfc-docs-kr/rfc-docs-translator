     If a STOP request successfully terminated one or more PENDING or
     IN-PROGRESS SPEAK requests, then the response MUST contain an Active-
     Request-Id-List header field enumerating the SPEAK request-ids that
     were terminated.  Otherwise, there is no Active-Request-Id-List
     header field in the response.  No SPEAK-COMPLETE events are sent for
     such terminated requests.

  STOP 요청이 하나 이상의 PENDING 또는 IN-PROGRESS SPEAK 요청을 성공적으로 종료한 경우 응답에는 종료된 SPEAK 요청 ID를 열거하는 Active-Request-Id-List 헤더 필드가 포함되어야 합니다. 그렇지 않은 경우 응답에 Active-Request-Id-List 헤더 필드가 없습니다. 이러한 종료된 요청에 대해 SPEAK-COMPLETE 이벤트가 전송되지 않습니다.
