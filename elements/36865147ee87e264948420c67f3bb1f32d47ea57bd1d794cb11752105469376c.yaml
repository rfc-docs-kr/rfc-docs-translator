     For each quantization table present, a bit in the Precision field
     specifies the size of the coefficients in that table.  If the bit is
     zero, the coefficients are 8 bits yielding a table length of 64
     bytes.  If the bit is one, the coefficients are 16 bits for a table
     length of 128 bytes.  For 16 bit tables, the coefficients are
     presented in network byte order.  The rightmost bit in the Precision
     field (bit 15 in the diagram above) corresponds to the first table
     and each additional table uses the next bit to the left.  Bits beyond
     those corresponding to the tables needed by the type in use MUST be
     ignored.
