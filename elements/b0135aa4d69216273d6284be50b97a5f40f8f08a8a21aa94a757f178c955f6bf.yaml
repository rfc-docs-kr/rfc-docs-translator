     Many of the use cases for delegated credentials can also be addressed
     using purely server-side mechanisms that do not require changes to
     client behavior (e.g., a PKCS#11 interface or a remote signing
     mechanism, [KEYLESS] being one example).  These mechanisms, however,
     incur per-transaction latency, since the front-end server has to
     interact with a back-end server that holds a private key.  The
     mechanism proposed in this document allows the delegation to be done
     offline, with no per-transaction latency.  The figure below compares
     the message flows for these two mechanisms with (D)TLS 1.3 [RFC8446]
     [RFC9147].
