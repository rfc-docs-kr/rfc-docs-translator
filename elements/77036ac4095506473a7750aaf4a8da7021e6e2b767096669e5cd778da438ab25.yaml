     If the peer attempts to authenticate to the authenticator and fails
     to do so, the authenticator MUST send a Failure packet and MUST NOT
     grant access by sending a Success packet.  However, an authenticator
     MAY omit having the peer authenticate to it in situations where
     limited access is offered (e.g., guest access).  In this case, the
     authenticator MUST send a Success packet.
