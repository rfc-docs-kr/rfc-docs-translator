                     Some part of the requested operation failed or was
                     not attempted for some reason.  Full cleanup has
                     not been performed (e.g., rollback not supported)
                     by the server.  The error-info container is used
                     to identify which portions of the application
                     data model content for which the requested operation
                     has succeeded (<ok-element>), failed (<bad-element>),
                     or not been attempted (<noop-element>).
