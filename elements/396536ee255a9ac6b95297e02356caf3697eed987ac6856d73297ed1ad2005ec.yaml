                   Implementers should be aware that applications
                   depending upon the all-subnets directed broadcast
                   address (f) may be unusable on some networks.  All-
                   subnets broadcast is not widely implemented in vendor
                   gateways at present, and even when it is implemented, a
                   particular network administration may disable it in the
                   gateway configuration.
