     Where the authentication process requires user input, the measured
     round trip times may be determined by user responsiveness rather than
     network characteristics, so that dynamic RTO estimation may not be
     helpful.  Instead, the retransmission timer SHOULD be set so as to
     provide sufficient time for the user to respond, with longer timeouts
     required in certain cases, such as where Token Cards (see Section
     5.6) are involved.
