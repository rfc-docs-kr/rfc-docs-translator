              additionally have one or more of the destination network's
              "host" bits set. For example, when originating an AS-
              external-LSA for the network 10.0.0.0 with mask of
              255.0.0.0, the Link State ID can be set to anything in the
              range 10.0.0.0 through 10.255.255.255 inclusive (although
              10.0.0.0 should be used whenever possible). The freedom to
              set certain host bits allows a router to originate separate
              LSAs for two networks having the same address but different
              masks. See Appendix E for details.
