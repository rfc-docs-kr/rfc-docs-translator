     A host's IP receiving layer must be modified to support broadcasting.
     In the absence of broadcasting, a host determines if it is the
     recipient of a datagram by matching the destination address against
     all of its IP addresses.  With broadcasting, a host must compare the
     destination address not only against the host's addresses, but also
     against the possible broadcast addresses for that host.
