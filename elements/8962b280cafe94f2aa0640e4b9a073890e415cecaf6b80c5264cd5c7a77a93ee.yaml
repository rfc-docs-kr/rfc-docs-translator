     Upon completion of the TLS handshake, the SMTP protocol is reset to
     the initial state (the state in SMTP after a server issues a 220
     service ready greeting).  The server MUST discard any knowledge
     obtained from the client, such as the argument to the EHLO command,
     which was not obtained from the TLS negotiation itself.  The client
     MUST discard any knowledge obtained from the server, such as the list
     of SMTP service extensions, which was not obtained from the TLS
     negotiation itself.  The client SHOULD send an EHLO command as the
     first command after a successful TLS negotiation.
