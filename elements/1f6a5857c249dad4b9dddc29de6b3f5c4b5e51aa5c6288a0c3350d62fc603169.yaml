     accounting request corresponding to the authorization response, the
     local realm implicitly indicates its agreement to provide the service
     indicated in the authorization response.  If the service cannot be
     provided by the local realm, then a DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY error
     message MUST be sent within the accounting request; a Diameter client
     receiving an authorization response for a service that it cannot
     perform MUST NOT substitute an alternate service and then send
     accounting requests for the alternate service instead.
