          (i.e., in terms of the link state metric).  Type 2 external
          metrics are an order of magnitude larger; any Type 2 metric is
          considered greater than the cost of any path internal to the AS.
          Use of Type 2 external metrics assumes that routing between
          AS'es is the major cost of routing a packet, and eliminates the
          need for conversion of external costs to internal link state
          metrics.
