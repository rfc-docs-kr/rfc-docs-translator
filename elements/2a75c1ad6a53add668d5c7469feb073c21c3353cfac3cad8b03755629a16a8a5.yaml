          When a neighbor's state changes, it may be necessary to rerun
          the Designated Router election algorithm.  This is determined by
          whether the interface NeighborChange event is generated (see
          Section 9.2).  Also, if the Interface is in DR state (the router
          is itself Designated Router), changes in neighbor state may
          cause a new network-LSA to be originated (see Section 12.4).
