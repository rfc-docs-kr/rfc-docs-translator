     The reuse of parameter blocks on a variety of functional data paths
     is intended to simplify network management.  In many cases, one could
     also re-use the structural elements as well; this has the unfortunate
     side-effect of re-using the counters, so that monitoring information
     is lost.  For this reason, the re-use of structural elements is not
     generally recommended.
