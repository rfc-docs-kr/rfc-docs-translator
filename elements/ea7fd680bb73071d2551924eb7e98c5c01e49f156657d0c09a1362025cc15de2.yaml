      Type 3 summary-LSAs are used when the destination is an IP network.
      In this case the LSA's Link State ID field is an IP network number
      (if necessary, the Link State ID can also have one or more of the
      network's "host" bits set; see Appendix E for details). When the
      destination is an AS boundary router, a Type 4 summary-LSA is used,
      and the Link State ID field is the AS boundary router's OSPF Router
      ID.  (To see why it is necessary to advertise the location of each
      ASBR, consult Section 16.4.)  Other than the difference in the Link
      State ID field, the format of Type 3 and 4 summary-LSAs is
      identical.
