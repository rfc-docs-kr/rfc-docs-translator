     Multimedia gateways may process multiplexed media streams.  For
     example, Recommendation H.221 describes a frame structure for
     multiple media streams multiplexed on a number of digital 64 kbit/s
     channels.  Such a case is handled in the connection model in the
     following way.  For every bearer channel that carries part of the
     multiplexed streams, there is a Termination.  The Terminations that
     source/sink the digital channels are connected to a separate
     Termination called the multiplexing Termination. This Termination
     describes the multiplex used (e.g. how the H.221 frames are carried
     over the digital channels used).  The MuxDescriptor is used to this
     end.  If multiple media are carried, this Termination contains
     multiple StreamDescriptors. The media streams can be associated with
     streams sourced/sunk by other Terminations in the Context.
