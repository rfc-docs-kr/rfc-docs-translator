              DISCUSSION:
                   If an implementation does not include an adequate
                   mechanism for detecting a dead gateway and re-routing,
                   a gateway failure may cause datagrams to apparently
                   vanish into a "black hole".  This failure can be
                   extremely confusing for users and difficult for network
                   personnel to debug.
