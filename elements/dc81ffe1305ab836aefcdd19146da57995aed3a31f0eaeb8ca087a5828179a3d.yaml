     As noted in [RFC2869], Section 5.19, a Message-Authenticator
     attribute SHOULD be included in an Access-Request that does not
     contain a User-Password, CHAP-Password, ARAP-Password, or EAP-Message
     Attribute.  The RADIUS server then will respond to the Access-Request
     with an Access-Accept to (re-)authorize the session or an Access-
     Reject to refuse to (re-)authorize it.
