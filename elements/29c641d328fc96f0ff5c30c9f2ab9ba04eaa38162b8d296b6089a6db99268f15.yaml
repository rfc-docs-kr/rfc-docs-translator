         indicated by diffServRandomDropProbMax of being dropped or
         marked. Note that this differs from the physical queue limit,
         which is stored in diffServAlgDropQThreshold. Changes in this
         variable may or may not be reflected in the reported value of
         diffServRandomDropMaxThreshBytes."
