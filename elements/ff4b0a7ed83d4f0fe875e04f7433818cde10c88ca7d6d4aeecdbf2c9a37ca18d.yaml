     4. The current dial string is compared to the candidate alternative
        event sequences.  If and only if a sequence expecting a long-
        duration event at this position is matched (i.e. the event had
        long duration and met the specification for this position), then
        any alternative event sequences not specifying a long duration
        event at this position are discarded, and the current dial string
        is modified by inserting a "Z" in front of the symbol representing
        the latest event.  Any sequence expecting a long-duration event at
        this position but not matching the observed event is discarded
        from the candidate set.   If alternative event sequences not
        specifying a long duration event in the given position remain in
        the candidate set after application of the above rules, the
        observed event duration is treated as irrelevant in assessing
        matches to them.
