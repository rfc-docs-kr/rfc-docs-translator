     A man-in-the-middle attack can be launched by deleting the "250
     STARTTLS" response from the server.  This would cause the client not
     to try to start a TLS session.  Another man-in-the-middle attack is
     to allow the server to announce its STARTTLS capability, but to alter
     the client's request to start TLS and the server's response.  In
     order to defend against such attacks both clients and servers MUST be
     able to be configured to require successful TLS negotiation of an
     appropriate cipher suite for selected hosts before messages can be
     successfully transferred.  The additional option of using TLS when
     possible SHOULD also be provided.  An implementation MAY provide the
     ability to record that TLS was used in communicating with a given
     peer and generating a warning if it is not used in a later session.
