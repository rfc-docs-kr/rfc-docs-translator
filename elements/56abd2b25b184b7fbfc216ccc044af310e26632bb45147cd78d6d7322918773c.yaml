     2.  The Diameter implementation performs a NAPTR query for a server
         in a particular realm.  The Diameter implementation has to know,
         in advance, in which realm to look for a Diameter agent.  This
         could be deduced, for example, from the 'realm' in an NAI on
         which a Diameter implementation needed to perform a Diameter
         operation.
