          Case 1: Area A is the backbone and/or the router is not an area
              border router.
              In this case, the following calculations must be performed.
              First, if there is presently an inter-area route to the
              destination N, N's routing table entry is invalidated,
              saving the entry's values for later comparisons. Then the
              calculation in Section 16.2 is run again for the single
              destination N. In this calculation, all of Area A's
              summary-LSAs that describe a route to N are examined.  In
              addition, if the router is an area border router attached to
              one or more transit areas, the calculation in Section 16.3
              must be run again for the single destination.  If the
              results of these calculations have changed the cost/path to
              an AS boundary router (as would be the case for a Type 4
              summary-LSA) or to any forwarding addresses, all AS-
              external-LSAs will have to be reexamined by rerunning the
              calculation in Section 16.4.  Otherwise, if N is now newly
              unreachable, the calculation in Section 16.4 must be rerun
              for the single destination N, in case an alternate external
              route to N exists.
