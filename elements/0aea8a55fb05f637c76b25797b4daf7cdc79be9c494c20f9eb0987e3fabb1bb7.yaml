                        When TCP is used for bulk transfer, the data
                        stream should be made up (almost) entirely of
                        segments of the size of the effective MSS.
                        Although TCP uses a sequence number space with
                        byte (octet) granularity, in bulk-transfer mode
                        its operation should be as if TCP used a sequence
                        space that counted only segments.
