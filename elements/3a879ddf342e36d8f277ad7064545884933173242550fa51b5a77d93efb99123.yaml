     In authenticated mode, only the sequence number in the first block is
     encrypted, and the subsequent timestamps and sequence numbers are
     sent in clear text.  Sending the timestamp in clear text allows one
     to reduce the time between when a timestamp is obtained by a
     Session-Reflector and when that packet is sent out.  This potentially
     improves the timestamp accuracy, because the sequence number can be
     encrypted before the timestamp is fetched.
