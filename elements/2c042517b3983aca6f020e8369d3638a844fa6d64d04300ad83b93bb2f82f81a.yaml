        This has a negative effect on inter-domain routing, particularly
        on those other domains which need to maintain routes to this
        domain.  There is no common prefix that can be used to represent
        these IP addresses and therefore no summarization can take place
        at the routing domain boundary. When addresses are advertised by
        this routing domain to other routing domains, an enumerated list
        of the three individual prefixes must be used.
