     Terminations may be created which represent multiplexed bearers, such
     as an ATM AAL Type 2 bearer.  When a new multiplexed bearer is to be
     created, an ephemeral termination is created in a context established
     for this purpose.  When the termination is subtracted, the
     multiplexed bearer is destroyed.
