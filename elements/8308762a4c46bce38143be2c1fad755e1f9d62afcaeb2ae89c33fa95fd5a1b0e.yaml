      Virtual links configured
          The virtual links configured with this router as one endpoint.
          In order to have configured virtual links, the router itself
          must be an area border router.  Virtual links are identified by
          the Router ID of the other endpoint -- which is another area
          border router.  These two endpoint routers must be attached to a
          common area, called the virtual link's Transit area.  Virtual
          links are part of the backbone, and behave as if they were
          unnumbered point-to-point networks between the two routers.  A
          virtual link uses the intra-area routing of its Transit area to
          forward packets.  Virtual links are brought up and down through
          the building of the shortest-path trees for the Transit area.
