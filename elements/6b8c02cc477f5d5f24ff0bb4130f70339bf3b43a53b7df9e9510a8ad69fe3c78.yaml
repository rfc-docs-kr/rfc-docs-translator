     Deployment of CIDR has certain implications on the segments of the
     Internet that are still using routing technology that can not support
     CIDR. Existing sites that rely solely on a default route for their
     external connectivity may not require support of VLSM capable routing
     technology for their interior routing and CIDR for their exterior
     routing. All sites lacking support for VLSM and CIDR capable routing
     must rely on a default route, which consequently may result in a
     various degree of suboptimal routing.  Organizations that operate as
     Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are expected to be able to support
     VLSM and CIDR.
