      The following fields are used to describe each router link (i.e.,
      interface). Each router link is typed (see the below Type field).
      The Type field indicates the kind of link being described.  It may
      be a link to a transit network, to another router or to a stub
      network.  The values of all the other fields describing a router
      link depend on the link's Type.  For example, each link has an
      associated 32-bit Link Data field.  For links to stub networks this
      field specifies the network's IP address mask.  For other link types
      the Link Data field specifies the router interface's IP address.
