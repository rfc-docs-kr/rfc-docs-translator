     What is now known as the Internet started as a research project in
     the 1970s to design and develop a set of protocols that could be used
     with many different network technologies to provide a seamless, end-
     to-end facility for interconnecting a diverse set of end systems.
     When it was determined how the 32-bit address space would be used,
     certain assumptions were made about the number of organizations to be
     connected, the number of end systems per organization, and total
     number of end systems on the network.  The end result was the
     establishment (see [RFC791]) of three classes of networks: Class A
     (most significant address bits '00'), with 128 possible networks each
     and 16777216 end systems (minus special bit values reserved for
     network/broadcast addresses); Class B (MSB '10'), with 16384 possible
     networks each with 65536 end systems (less reserved values); and
     Class C (MSB '110'), and 2097152 possible networks each and 254 end
     systems (256 bit combinations minus the reserved all-zeros and all-
     ones patterns).  The set of addresses with MSB '111' was reserved for
     future use; parts of this were eventually defined (MSB '1110') for
     use with IPv4 multicast and parts are still reserved as of the
     writing of this document.
