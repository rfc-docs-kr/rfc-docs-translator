     In particular, ICE requires an agent to obtain a local TCP candidate,
     bound to a local IP and port, then initiate a TCP connection from
     that local port (e.g., to the STUN server in order to obtain server
     reflexive candidates, to the TURN server to obtain a relayed
     candidate, or to the peer as part of a connectivity check), and be
     prepared to receive incoming TCP connections (for passive and
     simultaneous-open candidates).  A "typical" BSD socket is used either
     for initiating or receiving connections, and not for both.  The code
     required to allow incoming and outgoing connections on the same local
     IP and port is non-obvious.  The following pseudocode, contributed by
     Saikat Guha, has been found to work on many platforms:
