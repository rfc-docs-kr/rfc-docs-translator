        In addition, most of the solutions described also highlight the
        need for each TRD to develop policy on whether and under what
        conditions to accept addresses that are not based on its own
        address prefix, and how such non-local addresses will be treated.
        For example, a somewhat conservative policy might be that non-
        local IP address prefixes will be accepted from any attached leaf
        routing domain, but not advertised to other TRDs.  In a less
        conservative policy, a TRD might accept such non-local prefixes
        and agree to exchange them with a defined set of other TRDs (this
        set could be an a priori group of TRDs that have something in
        common such as geographical location, or the result of an
        agreement specific to the requesting leaf routing domain). Various
        policies involve real costs to TRDs, which may be reflected in
        those policies.
