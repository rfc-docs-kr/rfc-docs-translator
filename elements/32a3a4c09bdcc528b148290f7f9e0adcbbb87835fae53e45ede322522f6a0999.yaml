                For example, consider the valid_policy_tree shown in
                Figure 7 below.  The two nodes at depth i-1 that are
                marked with an 'X' have no children, and they are deleted.
                Applying this rule to the resulting tree will cause the
                node at depth i-2 that is marked with a 'Y' to be deleted.
                In the resulting tree, there are no nodes of depth i-1 or
                less without children, and this step is complete.
