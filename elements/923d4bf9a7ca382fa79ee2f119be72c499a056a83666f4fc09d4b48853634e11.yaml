     However, short-lived certificates need to be renewed more frequently
     than long-lived certificates.  If an external Certification Authority
     (CA) is unable to issue a certificate in time to replace a deployed
     certificate, the server would no longer be able to present a valid
     certificate to clients.  With short-lived certificates, there is a
     smaller window of time to renew a certificate and therefore a higher
     risk that an outage at a CA will negatively affect the uptime of the
     TLS-fronted service.
