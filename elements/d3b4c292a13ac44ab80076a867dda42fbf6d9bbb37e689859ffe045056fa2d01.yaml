      MaxAgeDiff
          The maximum time dispersion that can occur, as an LSA is flooded
          throughout the AS.  Most of this time is accounted for by the
          LSAs sitting on router output queues (and therefore not aging)
          during the flooding process.  The value of MaxAgeDiff is set to
          15 minutes.
