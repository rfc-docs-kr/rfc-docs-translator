     The corresponding media stream in the answer is formulated as
     described in Section 6, and may result in a change in media formats
     as well.  Similarly, as described in Section 6, as soon as it sends
     its answer, the answerer MUST begin sending media using any formats
     in the offer that were also present in the answer, and SHOULD use the
     most preferred format in the offer that was also listed in the answer
     (assuming the stream allows for sending), and MUST NOT send using any
     formats that are not in the offer, even if they were present in a
     previous SDP from the peer.  Similarly, when the offerer receives the
     answer, it MUST begin sending media using any formats in the answer,
     and SHOULD use the most preferred one (assuming the stream allows for
     sending), and MUST NOT send using any formats that are not in the
     answer, even if they were present in a previous SDP from the peer.
