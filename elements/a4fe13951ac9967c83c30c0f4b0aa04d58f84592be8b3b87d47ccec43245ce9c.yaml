           The <commit> operation instructs the device to implement the
           configuration data contained in the candidate configuration.
           If the device is unable to commit all of the changes in the
           candidate configuration datastore, then the running
           configuration MUST remain unchanged.  If the device does
           succeed in committing, the running configuration MUST be
           updated with the contents of the candidate configuration.
