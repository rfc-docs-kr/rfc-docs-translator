        Note that the relationship between routing and IP addressing
        described in other sections of this paper is concerned with
        problems in scaling caused by large, essentially public transit
        routing domains which interconnect a large number of routing
        domains.  However, for the purpose of IP address allocation,
        private links which interconnect only a small number of private
        routing domains do not pose a problem, and may be ignored. For
        example, this implies that a single leaf routing domain which has
        a single connection to a "public" backbone, plus a number of
        private links to other leaf routing domains, can be treated as if
        it were single-homed to the backbone for the purpose of IP address
        allocation.  We expect that this is also another way of dealing
        with multi-homed domains.
