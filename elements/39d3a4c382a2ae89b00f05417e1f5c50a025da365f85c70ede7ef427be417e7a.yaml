     The example provided in Figure 2 depicts a request issued from a NAS,
     which is an access device, for the user bob@example.com.  Prior to
     issuing the request, the NAS performs a Diameter route lookup, using
     "example.com" as the key, and determines that the message is to be
     relayed to a DRL, which is a Diameter relay.  The DRL performs the
     same route lookup as the NAS, and relays the message to the HMS,
     which is example.com's home server.  The HMS identifies that the
     request can be locally supported (via the realm), processes the
     authentication and/or authorization request, and replies with an
     answer, which is routed back to the NAS using saved transaction
     state.
