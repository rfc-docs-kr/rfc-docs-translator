     This is useful when protocol version upgrades are being performed in
     a network.  A node upgraded to a newer version should support the
     older versions used on other nodes it is communicating with.  Because
     ASPs initiate the ASP Up procedure, it is likely that the message
     having an unsupported version is an ASP Up message and therefore that
     the Error message would normally come from the SGP.
