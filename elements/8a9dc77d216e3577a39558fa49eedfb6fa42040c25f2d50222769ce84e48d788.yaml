     In the above scenario, datagrams travel from S to D through the Low-
     Power and Lossy Network Border Router (LBR).  Between S and the LBR,
     the datagrams are routed using the DAG built by the RPL and do not
     contain an SRH.  The LBR encapsulates received datagrams unmodified
     using IPv6-in-IPv6 and the SRH is included in the outer IPv6 header.
