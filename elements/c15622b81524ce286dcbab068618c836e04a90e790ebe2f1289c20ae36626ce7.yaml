     If a CoA-Request packet including a Service-Type value of "Authorize
     Only" is successfully processed, the NAS MUST respond with a CoA-NAK
     containing a Service-Type Attribute with value "Authorize Only", and
     an Error-Cause Attribute with value 507 (Request Initiated).  The NAS
     then MUST send an Access-Request to the RADIUS server including a
     Service-Type Attribute with value "Authorize Only", along with a
     State Attribute.  This Access-Request SHOULD contain the NAS
     identification attributes from the CoA-Request, as well as the
     session identification attributes from the CoA-Request permitted in
     an Access-Request; it also MAY contain other attributes permitted in
     an Access-Request.
