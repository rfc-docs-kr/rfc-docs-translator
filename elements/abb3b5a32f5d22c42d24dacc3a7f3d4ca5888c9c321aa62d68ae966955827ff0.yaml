     The procedure and guidelines for stopping test sessions is similar to
     that defined in Section 3.8 of OWAMP [RFC4656].  The Stop-Sessions
     command can only be issued by the Control-Client.  The message MUST
     NOT contain any session description records or skip ranges.  The
     message is terminated with a single block HMAC to complete the Stop-
     Sessions command.  Since the TWAMP Stop-Sessions command does not
     convey SIDs, it applies to all sessions previously requested and
     started with a Start-Sessions command.
