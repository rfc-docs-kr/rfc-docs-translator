     The REG RSP message is used as a response to the REG REQ message from
     a remote M3UA peer.  It contains indications of success/failure for
     registration requests and returns a unique Routing Context value for
     successful registration requests, to be used in subsequent M3UA
     Traffic Management protocol.
