                  o   Equal to the value that appears for vertex W on the
                      candidate list, calculate the set of next hops that
                      result from using the advertised link.  Input to
                      this calculation is the destination (W), and its
                      parent (V).  This calculation is shown in Section
                      16.1.1.  This set of hops should be added to the
                      next hop values that appear for W on the candidate
                      list.
