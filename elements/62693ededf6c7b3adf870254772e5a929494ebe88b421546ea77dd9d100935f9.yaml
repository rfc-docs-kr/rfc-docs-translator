            If a set of sites constitute a transit VPN, it is convenient
            to represent them as a BGP Confederation, so that the internal
            structure of the VPN is hidden from any router which is not
            within the VPN.  In this case, each site in the VPN would need
            two BGP connections to the backbone, one which is internal to
            the confederation and one which is external to it.  The usual
            intra-confederation procedures would have to be slightly
            modified in order to take account for the fact that the
            backbone and the sites may have different policies.  The
            backbone is a member of the confederation on one of the
            connections, but is not a member on the other.  These
            techniques may be useful if the customer for the VPN service
            is an ISP.  This technique allows a customer that is an ISP to
            obtain VPN backbone service from one of its ISP peers.
