     For Poly1305, the operations are addition, multiplication. and
     modulus, all on numbers with greater than 128 bits.  This can be done
     in constant time, but a naive implementation (such as using some
     generic big number library) will not be constant time.  For example,
     if the multiplication is performed as a separate operation from the
     modulus, the result will sometimes be under 2^256 and sometimes be
     above 2^256.  Implementers should be careful about timing side-
     channels for Poly1305 by using the appropriate implementation of
     these operations.
