     While implementations SHOULD support as many techniques as feasible,
     they SHOULD also consider which of them to use if multiple options
     are available.  Since different candidates are paired with each
     other, offering a large number of candidates results in a large check
     list and potentially long-lasting connectivity checks.  For example,
     using multiple NAT-assisted techniques with the same NAT usually
     results only in redundant candidates.  Similarly, using just one of
     the multiple UDP tunneling or relaying techniques is often enough.
