     In the case where a local event has caused the unavailability or
     congestion status of SS7 destinations, the M3UA layer at the ASP
     SHOULD pass up appropriate indications in the primitives to the M3UA
     User, as though equivalent SSNM messages were received.  For example,
     the loss of an SCTP association to an SGP may cause the
     unavailability of a set of SS7 destinations.  MTP-PAUSE indication
     primitives to the M3UA User are appropriate.
