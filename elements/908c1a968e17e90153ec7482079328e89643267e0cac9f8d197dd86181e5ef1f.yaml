     same address as a host within the local site. If that address were to
     appear in a packet, it would be forwarded to the internal node rather
     than through the NAT device to the external realm. Twice-NAT attempts
     to bridge these realms by translating both source and destination
     address of an IP packet, as the packet transitions realms.
