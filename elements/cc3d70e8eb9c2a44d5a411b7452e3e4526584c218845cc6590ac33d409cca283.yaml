            When these schemes are adaptive, they rely on measurement
            systems.  A measurement system monitors changes in traffic
            distribution, traffic loads, and network resource utilization
            and then provides feedback to the online or offline TE
            mechanisms and tools so that they can trigger control actions
            within the network.  The TE mechanisms and tools can be
            implemented in a distributed or centralized fashion.  A
            centralized scheme may have full visibility into the network
            state and may produce more optimal solutions.  However,
            centralized schemes are prone to single points of failure and
            may not scale as well as distributed schemes.  Moreover, the
            information utilized by a centralized scheme may be stale and
            might not reflect the actual state of the network.  It is not
            an objective of this document to make a recommendation between
            distributed and centralized schemes; that is a choice that
            network administrators must make based on their specific
            needs.
