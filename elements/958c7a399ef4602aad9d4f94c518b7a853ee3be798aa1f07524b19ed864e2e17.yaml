        If individual subnetworks take their IP addresses from a myriad of
        unrelated IP address spaces, there will be effectively no data
        abstraction beyond what is built into existing intra-domain
        routing protocols.  For example, assume that within a routing
        domain uses three independent prefixes assigned from three
        different IP address spaces associated with three different
        attached providers.
