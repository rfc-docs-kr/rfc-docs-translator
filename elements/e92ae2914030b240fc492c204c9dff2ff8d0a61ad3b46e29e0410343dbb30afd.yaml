     Contexts are identified by a ContextID, which is assigned by the
     Media Gateway and is unique within the scope of the Media Gateway.
     The Media Gateway Controller shall use the ContextID supplied by the
     Media Gateway in all subsequent Transactions relating to that
     Context.  The protocol makes reference to a distinguished value that
     may be used by the Media Gateway Controller when referring to a
     Termination that is currently not associated with a Context, namely
     the null ContextID.
