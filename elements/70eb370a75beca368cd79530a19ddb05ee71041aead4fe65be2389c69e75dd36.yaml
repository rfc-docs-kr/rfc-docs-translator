     CLOSED
        The CLOSED response code has no parameters.  A server returns the
        CLOSED response code when the currently selected mailbox is closed
        implicitly using the SELECT or EXAMINE command on another mailbox.
        The CLOSED response code serves as a boundary between responses
        for the previously opened mailbox (which was closed) and the newly
        selected mailbox; all responses before the CLOSED response code
        relate to the mailbox that was closed, and all subsequent
        responses relate to the newly opened mailbox.

  CLOSED - CLOSED 응답 코드에는 매개변수가 없습니다.  다른 사서함에서 SELECT 또는 EXAMINE 명령을 사용하여 현재 선택한 사서함이 암시적으로 닫히면 서버는 CLOSED 응답 코드를 반환합니다. CLOSED 응답 코드는 이전에 열었던 사서함(폐쇄된)에 대한 응답과 새로 선택한 사서함 사이의 경계 역할을 합니다. CLOSED 응답 코드 이전의 모든 응답은 닫힌 사서함과 관련이 있으며 모든 후속 응답은 새로 열린 사서함과 관련됩니다.
