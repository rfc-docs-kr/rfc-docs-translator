     For the purposes of DNAv4, manually assigned addresses may be treated
     as equivalent to DHCP-assigned addresses with an infinite lifetime.
     This does not significantly increase the probability of an address
     conflict as long as the manually assigned address is reserved by the
     DHCP server or is outside the scope of addresses assigned by a DHCP
     server.  However, where the manually assigned address is within an
     address scope utilized by a DHCP server, it is possible that the host
     will be unavailable when the DHCP server checks for a conflict prior
     to assigning the conflicting address.  In this case, a host utilizing
     DNAv4 could confirm an address that had been assigned to another
     host.
