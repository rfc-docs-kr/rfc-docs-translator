          In this same figure, Router RT5 will be originating 3 distinct
          AS-external-LSAs (one for each of the networks N12-N14).  These
          will be flooded throughout the entire AS, assuming that none of
          the areas have been configured as stubs.  However, if area 3 has
          been configured as a stub area, the AS-external-LSAs for
          networks N12-N14 will not be flooded into area 3 (see Section
          3.6).  Instead, Router RT11 would originate a default summary-
          LSA that would be flooded throughout area 3 (see Section
          12.4.3).  This instructs all of area 3's internal routers to
          send their AS external traffic to RT11.
