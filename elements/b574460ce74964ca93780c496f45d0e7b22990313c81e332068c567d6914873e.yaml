              Increments the DD sequence number in the neighbor data
              structure.  If the router has already sent its entire
              sequence of Database Description Packets, and the just
              accepted packet has the more bit (M) set to 0, the neighbor
              event ExchangeDone is generated.  Otherwise, it should send
              a new Database Description to the slave.
