     The ASN.1 description uses octet strings of up to 8 octets in length
     for Termination IDs.  This means that Termination IDs consist of at
     most 64 bits.  A fully specified Termination ID may be preceded by a
     sequence of wildcarding fields.  A wildcarding field is one octet in
     length.  Bit 7 (the most significant bit) of this octet specifies
     what type of wildcarding is invoked:  if the bit value equals 1, then
     the ALL wildcard is used; if the bit value if 0, then the CHOOSE
     wildcard is used.  Bit 6 of the wildcarding field specifies whether
     the wildcarding pertains to one level in the hierarchical naming
     scheme (bit value 0) or to the level of the hierarchy specified in
     the wildcarding field plus all lower levels (bit value 1).  Bits 0
     through 5 of the wildcarding field specify the bit position in the
     Termination ID at which the starts.
