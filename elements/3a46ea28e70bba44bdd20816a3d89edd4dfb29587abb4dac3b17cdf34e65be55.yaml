              o    The ICMP Timestamp server function returns a Timestamp
                   Reply to every Timestamp message that is received.  If
                   this function is implemented, it SHOULD be designed for
                   minimum variability in delay (e.g., implemented in the
                   kernel to avoid delay in scheduling a user process).
