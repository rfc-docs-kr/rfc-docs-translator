     The framing defined in RFC 4571 MUST be used when sending media.  For
     media streams that are not RTP-based and do not normally use RFC
     4571, the agent treats the media stream as a byte stream and assumes
     that it has its own framing of some sort, if needed.  It then takes
     an arbitrary number of bytes from the byte stream and places that as
     a payload in the RFC 4571 frames, including the length.  Next, the
     sender checks to see if the resulting set of bytes would be viewed as
     a STUN packet based on the rules in Sections 6 and 8 of [RFC5389].
     This includes a check on the most significant two bits, the magic
     cookie, the length, and the fingerprint.  If, based on those rules,
     the bytes would be viewed as a STUN message, the sender MUST utilize
     a different number of bytes so that the length checks will fail.
     Though it is normally highly unlikely that an arbitrary number of
     bytes from a byte stream would resemble a STUN packet based on all of
     the checks, it can happen if the content of the application stream
     happens to contain a STUN message (for example, a file transfer of
     logs from a client that includes STUN messages).
