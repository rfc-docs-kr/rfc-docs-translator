                   Approaches (1) and (2) involve ARP cache timeouts on
                   the order of a minute or less.  In the absence of proxy
                   ARP, a timeout this short could create noticeable
                   overhead traffic on a very large Ethernet.  Therefore,
                   it may be necessary to configure a host to lengthen the
                   ARP cache timeout.
