     It should be stressed that these projections do not consider that the
     current shortage of class B network numbers may increase the number
     of instances where many class C's are used rather than a class B.
     Using an assumption that new organizations which formerly obtained
     class B's will now obtain somewhere between 4 and 16 class C's, the
     rate of routing table growth can conservatively be expected to at
     least double and probably quadruple. This means the number of entries
     in a default-free routing table may well exceed 10,000 entries within
     six months and 20,000 entries in less than a year.
