     [d] An EAP implementation MAY clear SRTT and RTTVAR after backing off
         the timer multiple times, as it is likely that the current SRTT
         and RTTVAR are bogus in this situation.  Once SRTT and RTTVAR are
         cleared, they should be initialized with the next RTT sample
         taken as described in [RFC2988] equation 2.2.
