     A Termination is a logical entity on a MG that sources and/or sinks
     media and/or control streams.  A Termination is described by a number
     of characterizing Properties, which are grouped in a set of
     Descriptors that are included in commands. Terminations have unique
     identities (TerminationIDs), assigned by the MG at the time of their
     creation.
