     The use of short-lived certificates with automated certificate
     issuance, e.g., with the Automated Certificate Management Environment
     (ACME) [RFC8555], reduces the risk of key compromise but has several
     limitations.  Specifically, it introduces an operationally critical
     dependency on an external party (the CA).  It also limits the types
     of algorithms supported for (D)TLS authentication to those the CA is
     willing to issue a certificate for.  Nonetheless, existing automated
     issuance APIs like ACME may be useful for provisioning delegated
     credentials.
