     Implementation of this protocol extension does not ensure that each
     and every session and data transfer is secure, it merely provides the
     tools that allow a client and/or server to negotiate an acceptable or
     required level of security for that given session or data transfer.
     However, it is possible to have a server implementation that is
     capable of refusing to operate in an insecure fashion.
