     If the client's IGP does not support variable length subnet masks,
     this could be done by advertising the remainder of the class A's
     address space in appropriately sized subnets.  However, unless the
     client has a very large portion of the class A space, this is likely
     to result in a large number of subnets (for example, a mask of
     255.255.255.0 would require a total of 65535 subnets, including those
     allocated to the client).  For this reason, it may be preferable to
     simply use an IGP that supports variable length subnet masks within
     the client's domain.
