              The "Type-of-Service" byte in the IP header is divided into
              two sections:  the Precedence field (high-order 3 bits), and
              a field that is customarily called "Type-of-Service" or
              "TOS" (low-order 5 bits).  In this document, all references
              to "TOS" or the "TOS field" refer to the low-order 5 bits
              only.
