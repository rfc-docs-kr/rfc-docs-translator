     When studies look at cost (e.g., transit cost) or migration to ICN,
     realistic topologies should be used.  These can be inferred from
     Internet traces, such as the CAIDA Macroscopic Internet Topology Data
     Kit (http://www.caida.org/data/active/internet-topology-data-kit) and
     Rocketfuel
     (http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/networking/rocketfuel).  A
     problem is the large size of the topology (approximately 45K
     Autonomous Systems, close to 200K links), which may limit the
     scalability of the employed evaluation tool.  Katsaros et al.
     [Katsaros15] address this problem by using scaled down topologies
     created following the methodology described in [Dimitropoulos09].
