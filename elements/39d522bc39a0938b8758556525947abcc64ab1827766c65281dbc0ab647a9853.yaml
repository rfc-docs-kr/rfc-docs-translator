     The mechanism to generate a fingerprint is to take the hash of the
     DER-encoded certificate using a cryptographically strong algorithm,
     and convert the result into colon-separated, hexadecimal bytes, each
     represented by 2 uppercase ASCII characters.  When a fingerprint
     value is displayed or configured, the fingerprint is prepended with
     an ASCII label identifying the hash function followed by a colon.
     Implementations MUST support SHA-1 as the hash algorithm and use the
     ASCII label "sha-1" to identify the SHA-1 algorithm.  The length of a
     SHA-1 hash is 20 bytes and the length of the corresponding
     fingerprint string is 65 characters.  An example certificate
     fingerprint is:
