     Experience shows that, in practice, server implementations may fail
     to fully stop these attacks due to the complexity of this mitigation
     [ROBOT].  For (D)TLS 1.2 servers that support RSA key exchange using
     a DC-enabled end-entity certificate, a hypothetical signature forgery
     attack would allow forging a signature over a delegated credential.
     The forged delegated credential could then be used by the attacker as
     the equivalent of an on-path attacker, valid for a maximum of 7 days
     (if the default valid_time is used).
