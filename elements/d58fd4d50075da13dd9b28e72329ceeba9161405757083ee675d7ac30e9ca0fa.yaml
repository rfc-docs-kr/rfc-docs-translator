     A DigitMap is a dialing plan resident in the Media Gateway used for
     detecting and reporting digit events received on a Termination.  The
     DigitMap Descriptor contains a DigitMap name and the DigitMap to be
     assigned.  A digit map may be preloaded into the MG by management
     action and referenced by name in an EventsDescriptor, may be defined
     dynamically and subsequently referenced by name, or the actual
     digitmap itself may be specified in the EventsDescriptor. It is
     permissible for a digit map completion event within an Events
     Descriptor to refer by name to a DigitMap which is defined by a
     DigitMap Descriptor within the same command, regardless of the
     transmitted order of the respective descriptors.
