     <high 32 bits> and <low 32 bits> are decimal representations of the
     high and low 32 bits of a monotonically increasing 64-bit value.  The
     64-bit value is rendered in two part to simplify formatting by 32-bit
     processors.  At startup, the high 32 bits of the 64-bit value MAY be
     initialized to the time in NTP format [RFC5905], and the low 32 bits
     MAY be initialized to zero.  This will for practical purposes
     eliminate the possibility of overlapping Session-Ids after a reboot,
     assuming the reboot process takes longer than a second.
     Alternatively, an implementation MAY keep track of the increasing
     value in non-volatile memory.
