        Usage: Sometimes this term is used rather strictly to mean a card
        that closely conforms to the dimensions and appearance of the kind
        of plastic credit card issued by banks and merchants. At other
        times, the term is used loosely to include cards that are larger
        than credit cards, especially cards that are thicker, such as PC
        cards.

  - 사용법: 때때로 이 용어는 은행이나 가맹점에서 발행한 플라스틱 신용카드 종류의 크기와 모양에 밀접하게 일치하는 카드를 의미하기 위해 다소 엄격하게 사용됩니다. 다른 경우에는 이 용어가 신용 카드보다 큰 카드, 특히 PC 카드와 같이 두꺼운 카드를 포함하기 위해 느슨하게 사용됩니다.
