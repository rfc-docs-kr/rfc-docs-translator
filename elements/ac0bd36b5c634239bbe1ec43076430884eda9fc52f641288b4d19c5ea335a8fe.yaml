           o  Once in the ESTABLISHED state, it is possible to deliver
              segment data to user RECEIVE buffers.  Data from segments
              can be moved into buffers until either the buffer is full or
              the segment is empty.  If the segment empties and carries a
              PUSH flag, then the user is informed, when the buffer is
              returned, that a PUSH has been received.
