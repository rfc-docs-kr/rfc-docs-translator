        There are other possible solutions as well. A third approach is to
        assign each multi-homed organization a single address prefix,
        based on one of its connections to a TRD. Other TRDs to which the
        multi-homed organization are attached maintain a routing table
        entry for the organization, but are extremely selective in terms
        of which other TRDs are told of this route. This approach will
        produce a single "default" routing entry which all TRDs will know
        how to reach (since presumably all TRDs will maintain routes to
        each other), while providing more direct routing in some cases.
