     These timing diagrams aim to help explain exactly how the TLS
     handshake and session protection fits into the existing logic of the
     FTP protocol.  Of course, the FTP protocol itself is not well
     described with respect to the timing of commands and responses in
     [RFC-959], so this is partly based on empirical observation of
     existing widespread client and server implementations.
