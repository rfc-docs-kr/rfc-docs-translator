     Where keying material for the lower layer ciphersuite is itself
     provided by EAP, ciphersuite negotiation and key activation are
     controlled by the lower layer.  In PPP, ciphersuites are negotiated
     within ECP so that it is not possible to use keys derived from EAP
     authentication until the completion of ECP.  Therefore, an initial
     EAP exchange cannot be protected by a PPP ciphersuite, although EAP
     re-authentication can be protected.
