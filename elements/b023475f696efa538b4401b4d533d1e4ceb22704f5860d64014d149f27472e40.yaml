              In Point-to-MultiPoint mode, OSPF treats all router-to-
              router connections over the non-broadcast network as if they
              were point-to-point links. No Designated Router is elected
              for the network, nor is there an LSA generated for the
              network. In fact, a vertex for the Point-to-MultiPoint
              network does not appear in the graph of the link-state
              database.
