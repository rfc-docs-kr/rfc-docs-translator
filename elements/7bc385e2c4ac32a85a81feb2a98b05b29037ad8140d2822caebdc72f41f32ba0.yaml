     A "Z" designates a long duration event: placed in front of the
     symbol(s) designating the event(s) which satisfy a given digit
     position, it indicates that that position is satisfied only if the
     duration of the event exceeds the long-duration threshold.  The value
     of this threshold is assumed to be provisioned in the MG.
