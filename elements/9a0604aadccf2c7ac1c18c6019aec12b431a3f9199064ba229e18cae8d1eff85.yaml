     The MGC uses Local and Remote descriptors to reserve and commit MG
     resources for media decoding and encoding for the given Stream(s) and
     Termination to which they apply.  The MG includes these descriptors
     in its response to indicate what it is actually prepared to support.
     The MG SHALL include additional properties and their values in its
     response if these properties are mandatory yet not present in the
     requests made by the MGC (e.g., by specifying detailed video encoding
     parameters where the MGC only specified the payload type).
