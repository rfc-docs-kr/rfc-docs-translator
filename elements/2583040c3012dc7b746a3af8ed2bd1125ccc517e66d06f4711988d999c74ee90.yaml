     It is very difficult to modify the playback rate of audio.
     Typically, no more than a factor of two is possible while maintaining
     intelligibility by changing the pitch and rate of speech.  Music goes
     out of tune if one tries to manipulate the playback rate by
     resampling it.  This is a well-known problem, and audio is commonly
     muted or played back in short segments with skips to keep up with the
     current playback point.

  오디오 재생 속도를 수정하는 것은 매우 어렵습니다. 일반적으로 음성의 높낮이와 속도를 변경하여 명료도를 유지하면서 2배 이하의 요소만 가능합니다. 리샘플링을 통해 재생 속도를 조작하려고 하면 음악이 맞지 않게 됩니다. 이는 잘 알려진 문제이며, 현재 재생 지점을 따라가기 위해 오디오가 일반적으로 음소거되거나 짧은 세그먼트로 건너뛰어 재생됩니다.
