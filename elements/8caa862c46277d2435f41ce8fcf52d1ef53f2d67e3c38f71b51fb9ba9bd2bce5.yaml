        1. (I) An internetwork gateway that restricts data communication
        traffic to and from one of the connected networks (the one said to
        be "inside" the firewall) and thus protects that network's system
        resources against threats from the other network (the one that is
        said to be "outside" the firewall). (See: guard, security
        gateway.)
