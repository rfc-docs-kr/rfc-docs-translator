     The One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP), specified in RFC
     4656, provides a common protocol for measuring one-way metrics
     between network devices.  OWAMP can be used bi-directionally to
     measure one-way metrics in both directions between two network
     elements.  However, it does not accommodate round-trip or two-way
     measurements.  This memo specifies a Two-Way Active Measurement
     Protocol (TWAMP), based on the OWAMP, that adds two-way or round-trip
     measurement capabilities.  The TWAMP measurement architecture is
     usually comprised of two hosts with specific roles, and this allows
     for some protocol simplifications, making it an attractive
     alternative in some circumstances.
