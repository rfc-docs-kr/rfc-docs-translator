     The Origin-State-Id, if present, MUST reflect the state of the entity
     indicated by Origin-Host.  If a proxy modifies Origin-Host, it MUST
     either remove Origin-State-Id or modify it appropriately as well.
     Typically, Origin-State-Id is used by an access device that always
     starts up with no active sessions; that is, any session active prior
     to restart will have been lost.  By including Origin-State-Id in a
     message, it allows other Diameter entities to infer that sessions
     associated with a lower Origin-State-Id are no longer active.  If an
     access device does not intend for such inferences to be made, it MUST
     either not include Origin-State-Id in any message or set its value to
     0.
