     The ServiceChange Command allows the Media Gateway to notify the
     Media Gateway Controller that a Termination or group of Terminations
     is about to be taken out of service or has just been returned to
     service.   The Media Gateway Controller may indicate that
     Termination(s) shall be taken out of or returned to service.  The
     Media Gateway may notify the MGC that the capability of a Termination
     has changed.  It also allows a MGC to hand over control of a MG to
     another MGC.
