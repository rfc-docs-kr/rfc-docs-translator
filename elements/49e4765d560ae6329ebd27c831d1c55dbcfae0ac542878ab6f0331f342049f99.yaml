     If the transport sender does not authenticate the syslog transport
     receiver, then it may send data to an attacker.  This may disclose
     sensitive data within the log information that is useful to an
     attacker, resulting in further compromises within the system.  If a
     transport sender is operated in this mode, the data sent SHOULD be
     limited to data that is not valuable to an attacker.  In practice
     this is very difficult to achieve, so this type of configuration is
     NOT RECOMMENDED.
