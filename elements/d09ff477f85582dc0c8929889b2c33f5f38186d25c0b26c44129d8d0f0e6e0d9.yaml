     A ServiceChange Command specifying the "Root" for the TerminationID
     and ServiceChangeMethod equal to Restart is a registration command by
     which a Media Gateway announces its existence to the Media Gateway
     Controller.  The Media Gateway is expected to be provisioned with the
     name of one primary and optionally some number of alternate Media
     Gateway Controllers.  Acknowledgement of the ServiceChange Command
     completes the registration process, except when the MGC has returned
     an alternative ServiceChangeMgcId as described in the following
     paragraph.  The MG may specify the transport ServiceChangeAddress to
     be used by the MGC for sending messages in the ServiceChangeAddress
     parameter in the input ServiceChangeDescriptor. The MG may specify an
     address in the ServiceChangeAddress parameter of the ServiceChange
     request, and the MGC may also do so in the ServiceChange reply.  In
     either case, the recipient must use the supplied address as the
     destination for all subsequent transaction requests within the
     association.  At the same time, as indicated in section 9,
     transaction replies and pending indications must be sent to the
     address from which the corresponding requests originated.  This must
     be done even if it implies extra messaging because commands and
     responses cannot be packed together. The TimeStamp parameter shall be
     sent with a registration command and its response.
