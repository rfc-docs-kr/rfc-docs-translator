     If both agents are using the lite mode and if the offerer uses the
     a=setup:active attribute [RFC4145] in the new offer, the offerer MAY
     initiate the TCP connection on the selected pair in parallel with the
     new offer to speed up the connection establishment.  Consequently,
     the answerer MUST still accept incoming TCP connections to any of the
     passive candidates it listed in the answer, from any of the IP
     addresses the offerer listed in the initial offer.
