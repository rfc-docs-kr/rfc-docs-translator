     The second class is more interesting, requiring that the operation
     should complete on all devices or be fully reversed.  The network
     should either be transformed into a new state or be reset to its
     original state.  For example, a change to a VPN may require updates
     to a number of devices.  Another example of this might be adding a
     class-of-service definition.  Leaving the network in a state where
     only a portion of the devices have been updated with the new
     definition will lead to future failures when the definition is
     referenced.
