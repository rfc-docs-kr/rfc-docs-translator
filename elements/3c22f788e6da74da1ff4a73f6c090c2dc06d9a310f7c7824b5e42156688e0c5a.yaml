     When the graceful shutdown of the SCTP association has been
     accomplished, the SCTP layer returns an SCTP-SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE
     notification primitive to the local M3UA layer.  At the M3UA Layer
     that initiated the request, the M3UA layer will send an M-
     SCTP_RELEASE confirm primitive to Layer Management when the
     association shutdown is complete.  At the peer M3UA Layer, an M-
     SCTP_RELEASE indication primitive is sent to Layer Management upon
     abort or successful shutdown of an SCTP association.
