     After an ASP has successfully established an SCTP association to an
     SGP, the SGP waits for the ASP to send an ASP Up message, indicating
     that the ASP M3UA peer is available.  The ASP is always the initiator
     of the ASP Up message.  This action MAY be initiated at the ASP by an
     M-ASP_UP request primitive from Layer Management or MAY be initiated
     automatically by an M3UA management function.
