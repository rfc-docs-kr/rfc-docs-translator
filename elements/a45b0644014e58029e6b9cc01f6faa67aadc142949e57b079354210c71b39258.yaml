     At the present time, parts of the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone are delegated
     only on network boundaries which happen to fall on octet boundaries.
     To aid in the use of blocks of class-C networks, it is recommended
     that this policy be relaxed and allow the delegation of arbitrary,
     octet-oriented pieces of the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.
