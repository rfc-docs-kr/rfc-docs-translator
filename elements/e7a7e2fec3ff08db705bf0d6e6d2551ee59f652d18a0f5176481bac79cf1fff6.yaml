     Delegated credentials allow a peer to terminate (D)TLS connections on
     behalf of the certificate owner.  If a credential is stolen, there is
     no mechanism for revoking it without revoking the certificate itself.
     To limit exposure in case of the compromise of a delegated
     credential's private key, delegated credentials have a maximum
     validity period.  In the absence of an application profile standard
     specifying otherwise, the maximum validity period is set to 7 days.
     Peers MUST NOT issue credentials with a validity period longer than
     the maximum validity period or that extends beyond the validity
     period of the delegation certificate.  This mechanism is described in
     detail in Section 4.1.
