     EAP packets received with Code=1 (Request), Code=3 (Success), and
     Code=4 (Failure) are demultiplexed by the EAP layer and delivered to
     the peer layer.  Therefore, unless a host implements an EAP peer
     layer, these packets will be silently discarded.  Similarly, EAP
     packets received with Code=2 (Response) are demultiplexed by the EAP
     layer and delivered to the authenticator layer.  Therefore, unless a
     host implements an EAP authenticator layer, these packets will be
     silently discarded.  The behavior of a "pass-through peer" is
     undefined within this specification, and is unsupported by AAA
     protocols such as RADIUS [RFC3579] and Diameter [DIAM-EAP].
