         The effective key strength SHOULD be stated as a number of bits,
         defined as follows: If the effective key strength is N bits, the
         best currently known methods to recover the key (with non-
         negligible probability) require, on average, an effort comparable
         to 2^(N-1) operations of a typical block cipher.  The statement
         SHOULD be accompanied by a short rationale, explaining how this
         number was derived.  This explanation SHOULD include the
         parameters required to achieve the stated key strength based on
         current knowledge of the algorithms.
