     An early media request also lacks an indication of who specifically
     is making or modifying the request, and so it must be assumed that
     the Trust Domain is making the request.  Therefore, the information
     is only meaningful when securely received from a node known to be a
     member of the Trust Domain.

  초기 미디어 요청은 누가 구체적으로 요청을 하거나 수정하는지에 대한 표시도 없으므로 Trust Domain이 요청을 한다고 가정해야 합니다. 따라서 정보는 Trust Domain의 멤버로 알려진 노드에서 안전하게 수신될 때에만 의미가 있습니다.
