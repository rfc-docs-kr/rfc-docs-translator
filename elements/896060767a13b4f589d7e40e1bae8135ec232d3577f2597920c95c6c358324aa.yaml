     The "Refused - Management Blocking" error is sent when an ASP Up or
     ASP Active message is received and the request is refused for
     management reasons (e.g., management lockout).  If this error is in
     response to an ASP Active message, the Routing Context(s) in the ASP
     Active message SHOULD be included in the Error message.
