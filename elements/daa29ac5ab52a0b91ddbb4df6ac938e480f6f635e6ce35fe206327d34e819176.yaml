              The Precedence field is intended for Department of Defense
              applications of the Internet protocols.  The use of non-zero
              values in this field is outside the scope of this document
              and the IP standard specification.  Vendors should consult
              the Defense Communication Agency (DCA) for guidance on the
              IP Precedence field and its implications for other protocol
              layers.  However, vendors should note that the use of
              precedence will most likely require that its value be passed
              between protocol layers in just the same way as the TOS
              field is passed.
