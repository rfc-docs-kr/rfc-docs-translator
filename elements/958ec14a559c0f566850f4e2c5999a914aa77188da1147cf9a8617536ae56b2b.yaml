     [c] IEEE 802.11.  In IEEE 802.11, link layer indications include
         Disassociate and Deauthenticate frames (link failure
         indications), and the first message of the 4-way handshake (link
         success indication).  These messages are not authenticated or
         integrity protected, and although they are not forwardable, they
         are spoofable by an attacker within range.
