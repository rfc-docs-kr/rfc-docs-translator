          The reason behind the election algorithm's complexity is the
          desire for an orderly transition from Backup Designated Router
          to Designated Router, when the current Designated Router fails.
          This orderly transition is ensured through the introduction of
          hysteresis: no new Backup Designated Router can be chosen until
          the old Backup accepts its new Designated Router
          responsibilities.
