     Twice NAT is a variation of NAT in that both the source and
     destination addresses are modified by NAT as a datagram crosses
     address realms. This is in contrast to Traditional-NAT and Bi-
     Directional NAT, where only one of the addresses (either source or
     destination) is translated. Note, there is no such term as 'Once-
     NAT'.
