     Once a decoder has received either a single packet with both the F
     and L bits set on or a contiguous sequence of packets (based on the
     RTP sequence number) which begin with an F bit and end with an L bit,
     it can begin decoding.  The position of the MCU at the beginning of
     the data can be determined by multiplying the Restart Count value by
     the Restart Interval value.  A packet (or group of packets as
     identified by the F and L bits) may contain any number of consecutive
     restart intervals.
