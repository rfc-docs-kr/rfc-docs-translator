     [1] Unreliable transport.  In EAP, the authenticator retransmits
         Requests that have not yet received Responses so that EAP does
         not assume that lower layers are reliable.  Since EAP defines its
         own retransmission behavior, it is possible (though undesirable)
         for retransmission to occur both in the lower layer and the EAP
         layer when EAP is run over a reliable lower layer.
