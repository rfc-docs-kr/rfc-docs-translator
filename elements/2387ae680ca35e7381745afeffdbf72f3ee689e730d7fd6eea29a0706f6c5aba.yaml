     In the case where the answer message itself contains errors, any
     related session SHOULD be terminated by sending an STR or ASR
     message.  The Termination-Cause AVP in the STR MAY be filled with the
     appropriate value to indicate the cause of the error.  An application
     MAY also send an application-specific request instead of an STR or
     ASR message to signal the error in the case where no state is
     maintained or to allow for some form of error recovery with the
     corresponding Diameter entity.
