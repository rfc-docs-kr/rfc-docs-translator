     RSA-IP-Clients may pursue any of the IPsec techniques, namely
     transport or tunnel mode Authentication and confidentiality using AH
     and ESP headers on the embedded packets. Any of the tunneling
     techniques may be adapted for encapsulation between RSA-IP-Client and
     RSA-IP-Server or between RSA-IP-Client and external host.  For
     example, IPsec tunnel mode encapsulation is a valid type of
     encapsulation that ensures IPsec authentication and confidentiality
     for the embedded end-to-end packets.
