     When the TWAMP Light test sessions operate in authenticated or
     encrypted mode, the Session-Reflector MUST have some mechanism for
     generating keys (because the TWAMP-Control protocol normally plays a
     role in this process, but is not present here).  The specification of
     the key generation mechanism is beyond the scope of this memo.
