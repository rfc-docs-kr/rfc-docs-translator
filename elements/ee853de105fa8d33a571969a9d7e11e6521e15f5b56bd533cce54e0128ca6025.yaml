     As we have seen above, every ICN network is built from a set of
     resources, which include link capacities, and different types of
     memory structures and repositories used for storing named data
     objects and chunks temporarily (i.e., caching) or persistently, as
     well as name resolution and other lookup services.  A range of
     engineering trade-offs arise from the complexity and processing
     requirements of forwarding decisions, management needs (e.g., manual
     configuration, explicit garbage collection), and routing needs (e.g.,
     amount of state, manual configuration of routing tables, support for
     mobility).
