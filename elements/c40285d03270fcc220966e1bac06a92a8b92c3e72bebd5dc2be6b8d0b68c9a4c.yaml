     The receiver of a RST first validates it, then changes state.  If the
     receiver was in the LISTEN state, it ignores it.  If the receiver was
     in SYN-RECEIVED state and had previously been in the LISTEN state,
     then the receiver returns to the LISTEN state; otherwise, the
     receiver aborts the connection and goes to the CLOSED state.  If the
     receiver was in any other state, it aborts the connection and advises
     the user and goes to the CLOSED state.

  RST의 수신자는 먼저 이를 검증한 다음 상태를 변경합니다. 수신기가 LISTEN 상태인 ​​경우 이를 무시합니다. 수신기가 SYN-RECEIVED 상태이고 이전에 LISTEN 상태였던 경우 수신기는 LISTEN 상태로 돌아갑니다. 그렇지 않으면 수신기는 연결을 중단하고 CLOSED 상태로 전환됩니다. 수신기가 다른 상태에 있었다면 연결을 중단하고 사용자에게 알리고 CLOSED 상태로 이동합니다.
