     NETCONF connections MUST provide authentication, data integrity,
     confidentiality, and replay protection.  NETCONF depends on the
     transport protocol for this capability.  A NETCONF peer assumes that
     appropriate levels of security and confidentiality are provided
     independently of this document.  For example, connections could be
     encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] or Secure
     Shell (SSH) [RFC4251], depending on the underlying protocol.
