     There are two fundamental changes which must be applied to Inter-
     Domain routing protocols in order for this plan to work. First, the
     concept of network "class" needs to be deprecated - this plan assumes
     that routing destinations are represented by network and mask pairs
     and that routing is done on a longest-match basis (i.e., for a given
     destination which matches multiple network+mask pairs, the match with
     the longest mask is used).  Second, current inter-domain protocols
     generally do not support the concept of route aggregation, so the new
     semantics need to be implemented in a new set of inter-domain
     protocols. In particular, when doing aggregation, dealing with
     multi-homed sites or destinations which change service providers is
     difficult. Fortunately, it is possible to define several fairly
     simple rules for dealing with such cases.
