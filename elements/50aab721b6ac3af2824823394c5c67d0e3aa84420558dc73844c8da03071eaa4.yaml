     *  The scope of applicability for the information conveyed.  By
        default, fields apply only to the message they are associated
        with, but some response fields are designed to apply to all
        representations of a resource, the resource itself, or an even
        broader scope.  Specifications that expand the scope of a response
        field will need to carefully consider issues such as content
        negotiation, the time period of applicability, and (in some cases)
        multi-tenant server deployments.
