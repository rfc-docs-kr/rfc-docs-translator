              If the computed and received ICVs match, then the datagram
              is valid, and it is accepted.  If the test fails, then the
              receiver MUST discard the received IP datagram as invalid;
              this is an auditable event.  The log data SHOULD include the
              SPI value, date/time received, Source Address, Destination
              Address, the Sequence Number, and (for IPv6) the cleartext
              Flow ID.
