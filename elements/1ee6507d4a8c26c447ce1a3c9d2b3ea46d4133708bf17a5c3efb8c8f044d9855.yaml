     IEEE 802 networks may be used as IP networks of any class (A, B, or
     C).  These systems use two Link Service Access Point (LSAP) fields of
     the LLC header in much the same way the ARPANET uses the "link"
     field.  Further, there is an extension of the LLC header called the
     Sub-Network Access Protocol (SNAP).
