        If the lock is already held, the <error-tag> element will be
        "lock-denied" and the <error-info> element will include the
        <session-id> of the lock owner.  If the lock is held by a non-
        NETCONF entity, a <session-id> of 0 (zero) is included.  Note that
        any other entity performing a lock on even a partial piece of a
        target will prevent a NETCONF lock (which is global) from being
        obtained on that target.
