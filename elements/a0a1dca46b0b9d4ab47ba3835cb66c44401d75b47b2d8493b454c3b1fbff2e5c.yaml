     Notice that even though BGP routes do not have to be installed in the
     Routing Table with the immediate next-hop(s), implementations MUST
     take care that, before any packets are forwarded along a BGP route,
     its associated NEXT_HOP address is resolved to the immediate
     (directly connected) next-hop address, and that this address (or
     multiple addresses) is finally used for actual packet forwarding.

  BGP 경로가 바로 다음 홉이 있는 라우팅 테이블에 설치될 필요는 없지만 구현에서는 패킷이 BGP 경로를 따라 전달되기 전에 연관된 NEXT_HOP 주소가 다음으로 확인되도록 주의해야 합니다. 즉시(직접 연결된) 다음 홉 주소이며, 이 주소(또는 여러 주소)가 최종적으로 실제 패킷 전달에 사용됩니다.
