      Link Data
          Value again depends on the link's Type field. For connections to
          stub networks, Link Data specifies the network's IP address
          mask. For unnumbered point-to-point connections, it specifies
          the interface's MIB-II [Ref8] ifIndex value. For the other link
          types it specifies the router interface's IP address. This
          latter piece of information is needed during the routing table
          build process, when calculating the IP address of the next hop.
          See Section 16.1.1 for more details.
