     Commands provide control at the finest level of granularity supported
     by the protocol.  For example, Commands exist to add Terminations to
     a Context, modify Terminations, subtract Terminations from a Context,
     and audit properties of Contexts or Terminations. Commands provide
     for complete control of the properties of Contexts and Terminations.
     This includes specifying which events a Termination is to report,
     which signals/actions are to be applied to a Termination and
     specifying the topology of a Context (who hears/sees whom).
