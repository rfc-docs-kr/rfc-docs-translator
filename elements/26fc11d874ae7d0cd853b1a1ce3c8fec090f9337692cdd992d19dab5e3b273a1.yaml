     The TIME attack [TIME] and the later BREACH attack [BREACH] (CVE-
     2013-3587, though the number has not been officially allocated) both
     make similar use of HTTP-level compression to decrypt secret data
     passed in the HTTP response.  We note that compression of the HTTP
     message body is much more prevalent than compression at the TLS
     level.
