     The action table identifies sequences of actions to be applied to a
     packet.  Successive actions are chained through diffServActionNext,
     ultimately resulting in zeroDotZero (indicating that the policy is
     complete), a pointer to a queue, or a pointer to some other
     functional data path element.
