      Master/Slave
          When the two neighbors are exchanging databases, they form a
          master/slave relationship.  The master sends the first Database
          Description Packet, and is the only part that is allowed to
          retransmit.  The slave can only respond to the master's Database
          Description Packets.  The master/slave relationship is
          negotiated in state ExStart.
