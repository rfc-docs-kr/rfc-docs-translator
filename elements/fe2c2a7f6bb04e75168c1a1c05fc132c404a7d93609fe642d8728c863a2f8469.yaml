     The distribution of SS7 messages between the SGP and the Application
     Servers is determined by the Routing Keys and their associated
     Routing Contexts.  A Routing Key is essentially a set of SS7
     parameters used to filter SS7 messages, whereas the Routing Context
     parameter is a 4-octet value (integer) that is associated to that
     Routing Key in a 1:1 relationship.  The Routing Context therefore can
     be viewed as an index into a sending node's Message Distribution
     Table containing the Routing Key entries.
