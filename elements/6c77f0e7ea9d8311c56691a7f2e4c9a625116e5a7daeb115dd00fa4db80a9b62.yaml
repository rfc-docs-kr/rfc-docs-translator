        - For security reasons, many enterprises use application layer
          gateways (e.g., firewalls) to connect their internal network to
          the Internet.  The internal network usually does not have direct
          access to the Internet, thus only one or more firewall hosts are
          visible from the Internet.  In this case, the internal network
          can use non-unique IP numbers.
