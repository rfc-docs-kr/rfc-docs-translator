              (c)  The first Address Mask Reply message received MUST be
                   used to set the address mask corresponding to the
                   particular local IP address.  This is true even if the
                   first Address Mask Reply message is "unsolicited", in
                   which case it will have been broadcast and may arrive
                   after the host has ceased to retransmit Address Mask
                   Requests.  Once the mask has been set by an Address
                   Mask Reply, later Address Mask Reply messages MUST be
                   (silently) ignored.
