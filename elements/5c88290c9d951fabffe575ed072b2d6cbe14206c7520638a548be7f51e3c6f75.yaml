     This filter contains two containment nodes (<users>, <user>), one
     content match node (<name>), and two selection nodes (<type>,
     <full-name>).  All instances of the <type> and <full-name> elements
     in the same sibling set containing <name> for which the value of
     <name> equals "fred" are selected in the filter output.  The
     <company-info> element is not included because the sibling set
     contains selection nodes.
