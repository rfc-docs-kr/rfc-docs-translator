     A "Realm Specific IP Client" (RSIP client) is a host in a private
     network that adopts an address in an external realm when connecting
     to hosts in that realm to pursue end-to-end communication. Packets
     generated by hosts on either end in such a setup would be based on
     addresses that are end-to-end unique in the external realm and do not
     require translation by an intermediary process.
