           (1)  If permittedSubtrees is present in the certificate, set
                the permitted_subtrees state variable to the intersection
                of its previous value and the value indicated in the
                extension field.  If permittedSubtrees does not include a
                particular name type, the permitted_subtrees state
                variable is unchanged for that name type.  For example,
                the intersection of example.com and foo.example.com is
                foo.example.com.  And the intersection of example.com and
                example.net is the empty set.
