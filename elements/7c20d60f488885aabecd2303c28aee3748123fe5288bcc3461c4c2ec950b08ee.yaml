      There are five distinct OSPF packet types.  All OSPF packet types
      begin with a standard 24 byte header.  This header is described
      first.  Each packet type is then described in a succeeding section.
      In these sections each packet's division into fields is displayed,
      and then the field definitions are enumerated.
