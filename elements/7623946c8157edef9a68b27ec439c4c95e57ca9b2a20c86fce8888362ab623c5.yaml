     If the accounted service is of a measurable length, then the AVP MUST
     use the values START_RECORD, STOP_RECORD, and possibly,
     INTERIM_RECORD.  If the authorization server has not directed interim
     accounting to be enabled for the session, two accounting records MUST
     be generated for each service of type session.  When the initial
     Accounting-Request for a given session is sent, the Accounting-
     Record-Type AVP MUST be set to the value START_RECORD.  When the last
     Accounting-Request is sent, the value MUST be STOP_RECORD.
