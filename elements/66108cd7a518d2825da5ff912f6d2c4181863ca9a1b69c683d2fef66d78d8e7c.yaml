     The client SHOULD NOT remove the accounting data from any of its
     memory areas before the correct Accounting-Answer has been received.
     The client MAY remove the oldest, undelivered, or as yet
     unacknowledged accounting data if it runs out of resources such as
     memory.  It is an implementation-dependent matter for the client to
     accept new sessions under this condition.
