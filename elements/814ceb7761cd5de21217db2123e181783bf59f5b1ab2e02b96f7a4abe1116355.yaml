              DISCUSSION:
                   A "keep-alive" mechanism periodically probes the other
                   end of a connection when the connection is otherwise
                   idle, even when there is no data to be sent.  The TCP
                   specification does not include a keep-alive mechanism
                   because it could:  (1) cause perfectly good connections
                   to break during transient Internet failures; (2)
                   consume unnecessary bandwidth ("if no one is using the
                   connection, who cares if it is still good?"); and (3)
                   cost money for an Internet path that charges for
                   packets.
