     An implementer could leverage an approach described as the "N+1 and
     N+2" release strategy.  In release N+1, the implementer introduces a
     new default configuration parameter to indicate that the BGP speaker
     is operating in "ebgp insecure-mode".  In addition to the
     introduction of the new parameter, an implementer could begin to
     display informational warnings to the operator that certain parts of
     the configuration are incomplete.  In release N+1, operators of the
     BGP implementation become aware that a configurable default exists in
     the implementation, and can prepare accordingly.  In release N+2 or
     later, the inverse of the previous default configuration parameter
     that was introduced in release N+1 becomes the new default.
