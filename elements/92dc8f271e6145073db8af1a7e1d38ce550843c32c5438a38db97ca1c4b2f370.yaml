     Before proceeding, we should note that we would like our metrics to
     be applicable to host-centric networks as well.  Standard metrics
     already exist for IP networks, and it would certainly be beneficial
     to take them into account.  It is encouraging that many of the
     metrics used by existing ICN approaches can also be used on IP
     networks and that all of the approaches have tried on occasion to
     draw the parallels.
