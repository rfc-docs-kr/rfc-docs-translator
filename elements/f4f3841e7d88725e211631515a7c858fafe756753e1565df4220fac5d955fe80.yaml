          List manipulation primitives
              Much of the OSPF functionality is described in terms of its
              operation on lists of LSAs.  For example, the collection of
              LSAs that will be retransmitted to an adjacent router until
              acknowledged are described as a list.  Any particular LSA
              may be on many such lists.  An OSPF implementation needs to
              be able to manipulate these lists, adding and deleting
              constituent LSAs as necessary.
