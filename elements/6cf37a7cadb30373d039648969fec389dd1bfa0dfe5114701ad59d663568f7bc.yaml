     While traffic metrics are more important for the end user, the owner
     or operator of the networking infrastructure is normally more
     interested in system metrics, which can reveal the efficiency of an
     approach.  The most common system metrics used are: protocol
     overhead, total traffic, transit traffic, cost savings, router cost,
     and router energy consumption.
