     Random droppers often have their drop probability function described
     as a plot of drop probability (P) against averaged queue length (Q).
     (Qmin,Pmin) then defines the start of the characteristic plot.
     Normally Pmin=0, meaning with average queue length below Qmin, there
     will be no drops.  (Qmax,Pmax) defines a "knee" on the plot, after
     which point the drop probability becomes more progressive (greater
     slope).  (Qclip,1) defines the queue length at which all packets will
     be dropped.  Notice this is different from Tail Drop because this
     uses an averaged queue length, although it is possible for Qclip to
     equal Qmax.
