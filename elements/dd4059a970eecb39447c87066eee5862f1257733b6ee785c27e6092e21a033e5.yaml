           - Otherwise, if the route being announced was learned from an
             external peer, the speaker can use an IP address of any
             adjacent router (known from the received NEXT_HOP attribute)
             that the speaker itself uses for local route calculation in
             the NEXT_HOP attribute, provided that peer X shares a common
             subnet with this address.  This is a second form of "third
             party" NEXT_HOP attribute.
