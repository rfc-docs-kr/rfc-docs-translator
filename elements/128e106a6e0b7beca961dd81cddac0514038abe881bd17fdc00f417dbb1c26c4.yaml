              IMPLEMENTATION:
                   The receiver's SWS avoidance algorithm determines when
                   the right window edge may be advanced; this is
                   customarily known as "updating the window".  This
                   algorithm combines with the delayed ACK algorithm (see
                   Section 4.2.3.2) to determine when an ACK segment
                   containing the current window will really be sent to
                   the receiver.  We use the notation of RFC-793; see
                   Figures 4 and 5 in that document.
