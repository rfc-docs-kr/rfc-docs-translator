     Diameter servers MUST support the base protocol, which includes
     accounting.  In addition, they MUST fully support each Diameter
     application that is needed to implement the intended service, e.g.,
     NASREQ and/or Mobile IPv4.  A Diameter server MUST be referred to as
     "Diameter X Server" where X is the application that it supports, and
     not a "Diameter Server".
