     When a MGC wants the MG to respond to a continuity test, it sends a
     command to the MG containing a signals descriptor with the rsp
     signal.  Upon reception of a command with the rsp signal, the MG
     either applies a loopback or (for 2-wire circuits) awaits reception
     of a continuity test tone.  In the loopback case, any incoming
     information shall be reflected back as outgoing information.  In the
     2-wire case, any time the appropriate test tone is received, the
     appropriate response tone should be sent.  The MGC determines when to
     remove the rsp signal.
