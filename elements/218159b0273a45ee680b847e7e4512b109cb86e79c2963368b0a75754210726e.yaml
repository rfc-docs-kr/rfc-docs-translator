                   Each route cache entry defines the endpoints of an
                   Internet path.  Although the connecting path may change
                   dynamically in an arbitrary way, the transmission
                   characteristics of the path tend to remain
                   approximately constant over a time period longer than a
                   single typical host-host transport connection.
                   Therefore, a route cache entry is a natural place to
                   cache data on the properties of the path.  Examples of
                   such properties might be the maximum unfragmented
                   datagram size (see Section 3.3.3), or the average
                   round-trip delay measured by a transport protocol.
                   This data will generally be both gathered and used by a
                   higher layer protocol, e.g., by TCP, or by an
                   application using UDP.  Experiments are currently in
                   progress on caching path properties in this manner.
