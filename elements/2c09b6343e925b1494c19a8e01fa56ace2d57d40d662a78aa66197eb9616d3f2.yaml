      DESCRIPTION
         "For use with diffServSchedulerMethod to indicate the Weighted
         Round Robin scheduling method, defined as any algorithm in which
         a set of queues are visited in a fixed order, and varying amounts
         of traffic are removed from each queue in turn to implement an
         average output rate by class. Notice attributes from
         diffServMinRateEntry of the queues/schedulers feeding this
         scheduler are used when determining the next packet to schedule."
