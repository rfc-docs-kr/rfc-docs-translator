     Since both the ASR/ASA and Disconnect-Request/Disconnect-
     NAK/Disconnect-ACK exchanges involve just a request and response,
     inclusion of an "Authorize Only" Service-Type within a Disconnect-
     Request is not needed to assist in Diameter/RADIUS translation, and
     may make translation more difficult.  As a result, as noted in
     Section 3.2, the Service-Type Attribute MUST NOT be used within a
     Disconnect-Request.
