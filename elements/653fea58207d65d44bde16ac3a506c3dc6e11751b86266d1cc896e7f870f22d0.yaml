     *  The priority is used for a context in order to provide the MG with
        information about a certain precedence handling for a context. The
        MGC can also use the priority to control autonomously the traffic
        precedence in the MG in a smooth way in certain situations (e.g.
        restart), when a lot of contexts must be handled simultaneously.
