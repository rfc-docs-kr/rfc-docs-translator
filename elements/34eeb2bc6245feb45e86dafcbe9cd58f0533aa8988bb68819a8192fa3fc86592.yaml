        An Application Server Process may be configured to process traffic
        for more than one logical Application Server.  From the
        perspective of an ASP, a Routing Context defines a range of
        signalling traffic that the ASP is currently configured to receive
        from the SGP.  For example, an ASP could be configured to support
        signalling for multiple MTP3-Users, identified by separate SS7
        DPC/OPC/SI ranges.
