     The procedure uses a long timer value, noted LONG-TIMER in the
     following.  The timer should be set larger than the maximum duration
     of a transaction, which should take into account the maximum number
     of repetitions, the maximum value of the repetition timer and the
     maximum propagation delay of a packet in the network.  A suggested
     value is 30 seconds.
