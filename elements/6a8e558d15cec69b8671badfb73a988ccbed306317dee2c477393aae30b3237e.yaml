            This option allows the receiver to determine the time of the
            most recent access of the client.  It is particularly useful
            when DHCPLEASEACTIVE messages from two different DHCP servers
            need to be compared, although it can be useful in other
            situations.  The value is a duration in seconds from the
            current time into the past when this IP address was most
            recently the subject of communication between the client and
            the DHCP server.
