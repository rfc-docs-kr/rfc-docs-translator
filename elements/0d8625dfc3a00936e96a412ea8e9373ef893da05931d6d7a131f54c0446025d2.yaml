     The Meter Table is a structural table, specifying a specific
     functional data path element.  Its entry consists essentially of
     three RowPointers - a "succeed" pointer, for traffic conforming to
     the meter, a "fail" pointer, for traffic not conforming to the meter,
     and a "specific" pointer, to identify the parameters in question.
     This structure is a bow to SNMP's limitations; it would be better to
     have a structure with N rates and N+1 "next" pointers, with a single
     algorithm specified.  In this case, multiple meter entries connected
     by the "fail" link are understood to contain the parameters for a
     specified algorithm, and traffic conforming to a given rate follows
     their "succeed" paths.  Within this MIB, only Token Bucket parameters
     are specified; other varieties of meters may be designed in other MIB
     modules.
