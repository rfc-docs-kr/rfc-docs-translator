        The Generic Token Card Type is defined for use with various Token
        Card implementations which require user input.  The Request
        contains a displayable message and the Response contains the Token
        Card information necessary for authentication.  Typically, this
        would be information read by a user from the Token card device and
        entered as ASCII text.  A Response MUST be sent in reply to the
        Request.  The Response MUST be of Type 6 (GTC), Nak (Type 3), or
        Expanded Nak (Type 254).  The Nak Response indicates the peer's
        desired authentication Type(s).  The EAP GTC method is intended
        for use with the Token Cards supporting challenge/response
