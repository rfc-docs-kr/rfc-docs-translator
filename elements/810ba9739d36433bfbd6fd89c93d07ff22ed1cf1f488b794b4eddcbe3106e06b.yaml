             Action:  The router must list the contents of its entire area
                      link state database in the neighbor Database summary
                      list.  The area link state database consists of the
                      router-LSAs, network-LSAs and summary-LSAs contained
                      in the area structure, along with the AS-external-
                      LSAs contained in the global structure.  AS-
                      external-LSAs are omitted from a virtual neighbor's
                      Database summary list.  AS-external-LSAs are omitted
                      from the Database summary list if the area has been
                      configured as a stub (see Section 3.6).  LSAs whose
                      age is equal to MaxAge are instead added to the
                      neighbor's Link state retransmission list.  A
                      summary of the Database summary list will be sent to
                      the neighbor in Database Description packets.  Each
                      Database Description Packet has a DD sequence
                      number, and is explicitly acknowledged.  Only one
                      Database Description Packet is allowed outstanding
                      at any one time.  For more detail on the sending and
                      receiving of Database Description packets, see
                      Sections 10.8 and 10.6.
