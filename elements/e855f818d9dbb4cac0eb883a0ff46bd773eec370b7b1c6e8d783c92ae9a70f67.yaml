          PollInterval
              If a neighboring router has become inactive (Hello Packets
              have not been seen for RouterDeadInterval seconds), it may
              still be necessary to send Hello Packets to the dead
              neighbor.  These Hello Packets will be sent at the reduced
              rate PollInterval, which should be much larger than
              HelloInterval.  Sample value for a PDN X.25 network: 2
              minutes.
