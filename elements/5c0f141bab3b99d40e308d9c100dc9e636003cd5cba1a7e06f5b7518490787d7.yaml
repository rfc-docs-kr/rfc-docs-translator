     The control association between MG and MGC is initiated at MG cold
     start, and announced by a ServiceChange message, but can be changed
     by subsequent events, such as failures or manual service events.
     While the protocol does not have an explicit mechanism to support
     multiple MGCs controlling a physical MG, it has been designed to
     support the multiple logical MG (within a single physical MG) that
     can be associated with different MGCs.
