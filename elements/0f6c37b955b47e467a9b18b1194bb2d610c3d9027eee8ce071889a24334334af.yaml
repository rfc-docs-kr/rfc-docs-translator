        In some cases, such private links may be permitted to forward
        traffic for a small number of other routing domains, such as
        closely affiliated organizations. This will increase the
        configuration requirements slightly. However, provided that the
        number of organizations using the link is relatively small, then
        this still does not represent a significant problem.
