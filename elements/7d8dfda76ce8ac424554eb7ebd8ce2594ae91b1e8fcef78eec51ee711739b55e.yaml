     A TransactionReply includes the results for all of the Commands in
     the corresponding TransactionRequest.  The TransactionReply includes
     the return values for the Commands that were executed successfully,
     and the Command and error descriptor for any Command that failed.
     TransactionPending is used to periodically notify the receiver that a
     Transaction has not completed yet, but is actively being processed.
