     Progressing XML Digital Signature [RFC3275] along the Standards Track
     required removal of any algorithms from the original version
     [RFC3075] for which there was not demonstrated interoperability.
     This required removal of the Minimal Canonicalization algorithm, in
     which there was continued interest.  The URI for Minimal
     Canonicalization was included in [RFC6931] and is included here.

  표준 트랙을 따라 XML 디지털 서명 [RFC3275]을 진행하려면 상호 운용성이 입증되지 않은 원본 버전 [RFC3075]에서 모든 알고리즘을 제거해야 했습니다. 이를 위해서는 지속적인 관심이 있었던 최소 정규화 알고리즘을 제거해야 했습니다. 최소 정규화를 위한 URI는 [RFC6931]에 포함되어 있으며 여기에도 포함되어 있습니다.
