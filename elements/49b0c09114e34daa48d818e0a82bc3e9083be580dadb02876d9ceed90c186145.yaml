     As the RFC Series has evolved over the years, there has been
     increasing concern over appropriate labeling of the publications to
     make clear the status of each RFC and the status of the work it
     describes.  Chiefly, there is a requirement that RFCs published as
     part of the IETF's review process not be easily confused with RFCs
     that may have had a very different review and approval process.
     Various adjustments have been made over the years, including evolving
     text of "Notes" included in the published RFC.

  RFC 시리즈가 수년에 걸쳐 발전함에 따라 각 RFC의 상태와 그것이 설명하는 작업의 상태를 명확하게 하기 위해 출판물의 적절한 라벨링에 대한 관심이 증가해 왔습니다.  무엇보다도 IETF 검토 프로세스의 일부로 게시된 RFC는 검토 및 승인 프로세스가 매우 다를 수 있는 RFC와 쉽게 혼동되지 않아야 한다는 요구 사항이 있습니다. 게시된 RFC에 포함된 "메모"의 텍스트 변경을 포함하여 수년에 걸쳐 다양한 조정이 이루어졌습니다.
