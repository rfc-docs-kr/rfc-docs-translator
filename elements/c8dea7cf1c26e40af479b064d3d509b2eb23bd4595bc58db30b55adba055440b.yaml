     The MTP3 at the SGP will generate an MTP-RESUME indication primitive
     when it determines locally that an SS7 destination that was
     previously unreachable is now reachable.  The M3UA layer will map
     this primitive to a DAVA message.  The SGP M3UA determines the set of
     concerned ASPs to be informed based on internal SS7 network
     information associated with the MTP-RESUME indication primitive.
