     As discussed in [MODEL], a meter and a shaper are functions that
     operate on opposing ends of a link.  A shaper schedules traffic for
     transmission at specific times in order to approximate a particular
     line speed or combination of line speeds.  In its simplest form, if
     the traffic stream contains constant sized packets, it might transmit
     one packet per unit time to build the equivalent of a CBR circuit.
     However, various factors intervene to make the approximation inexact;
     multiple classes of traffic may occasionally schedule their traffic
     at the same time, the variable length nature of IP traffic may
     introduce variation, and factors in the link or physical layer may
     change traffic timing.  A meter integrates the arrival rate of
     traffic and determines whether the shaper at the far end was
     correctly applied, or whether the behavior of the application in
     question is naturally close enough to such behavior to be acceptable
     under a given policy.
