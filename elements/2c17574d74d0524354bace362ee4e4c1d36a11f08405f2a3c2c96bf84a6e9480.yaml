     In a method supporting result indications, a peer that has
     authenticated the server does not consider the authentication
     successful until it receives an indication that the server
     successfully authenticated it.  Similarly, a server that has
     successfully authenticated the peer does not consider the
     authentication successful until it receives an indication that the
     peer has authenticated the server.
