        "Request Not Routable" is a fatal error that MAY be sent by a
        proxy and MUST NOT be sent by a NAS.  It indicates that the proxy
        was unable to determine how to route a CoA-Request or Disconnect-
        Request to the NAS.  For example, this can occur if the required
        entries are not present in the proxy's realm routing table.
