     In partial failure, or manual maintenance reasons, an MGC may wish to
     direct its controlled MGs to use a different MGC.  To do so, it sends
     a ServiceChange method to the MG with a "HandOff" method, and its
     designated replacement in ServiceChangeMgcId. The MG should send a
     ServiceChange message with a "Handoff" method and a "MGC directed
     change" reason to the designated MGC.  If it fails to get a reply, or
     fails to see an Audit command subsequently, it should behave as if
     its MGC failed, and start contacting secondary MGCs.  If the MG is
     unable to establish a control relationship with any MGC, it shall
     wait a random amount of time as described in section 9.2 and then
     start contacting its primary, and if necessary, its secondary MGCs
     again.
