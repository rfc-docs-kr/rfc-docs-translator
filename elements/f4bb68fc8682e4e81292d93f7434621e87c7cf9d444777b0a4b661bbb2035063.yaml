     that the "child" may not follow a less-specific route for a
     destination that matches one of its own aggregated routes (typically,
     this is implemented by installing a "discard" or "null" route for all
     aggregated prefixes that one network advertises to another).  Note
     that handling of the "default" route (0.0.0.0/0) is a special case of
     this rule; a network must not follow the default to destinations that
     are part of one of its aggregated advertisements.
