     The 4WARD and SAIL projects have open-sourced software that
     implements different aspects of NetInf, e.g., the NetInf URI format
     and HTTP and UDP convergence layer, using different programming
     languages.  The Java implementation provides a local caching proxy
     and client.  Further, an OpenNetInf prototype is available as well as
     a hybrid host-centric and information-centric network architecture
     called the Global Information Network (GIN), a browser plug-in and
     video-streaming software.  See <http://www.netinf.org/open-source>
     for more details.
