     If a DHCPv4 client is operational, it is RECOMMENDED that the host
     attempt to obtain IPv4 configuration via DHCPv4 in parallel with the
     reachability tests, with the host using the first answer returned.
     This ensures that the DNAv4 procedure will not result in additional
     delay in the case where reachability tests fail, or where sending a
     DHCPREQUEST from the INIT-REBOOT state, as described in Section 3.2
     and 4.3.2 of the DHCP specification [RFC2131], completes more quickly
     than the reachability tests.
