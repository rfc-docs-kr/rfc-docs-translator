        A sub-session represents a distinct service (e.g., QoS or data
        characteristics) provided to a given session.  These services may
        happen concurrently (e.g., simultaneous voice and data transfer
        during the same session) or serially.  These changes in sessions
        are tracked with the Accounting-Sub-Session-Id.
