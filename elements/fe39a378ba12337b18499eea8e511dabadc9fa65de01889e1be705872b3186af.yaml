        The MD5-Challenge Type is analogous to the PPP CHAP protocol
        [RFC1994] (with MD5 as the specified algorithm).  The Request
        contains a "challenge" message to the peer.  A Response MUST be
        sent in reply to the Request.  The Response MAY be either of Type
        4 (MD5-Challenge), Nak (Type 3), or Expanded Nak (Type 254).  The
        Nak reply indicates the peer's desired authentication Type(s).
        EAP peer and EAP server implementations MUST support the MD5-
        Challenge mechanism.  An authenticator that supports only pass-
        through MUST allow communication with a backend authentication
        server that is capable of supporting MD5-Challenge, although the
        EAP authenticator implementation need not support MD5-Challenge
        itself.  However, if the EAP authenticator can be configured to
        authenticate peers locally (e.g., not operate in pass-through),
        then the requirement for support of the MD5-Challenge mechanism
        applies.
