     When gathering candidates from a host interface, the agent typically
     obtains active, passive, and S-O candidates.  Similarly, one can use
     different techniques for obtaining, e.g., server reflexive, NAT-
     assisted, tunneled, or relayed candidates of these three types (see
     Section 5).  Connections to servers used for relayed and server
     reflexive candidates are kept open during ICE processing.
