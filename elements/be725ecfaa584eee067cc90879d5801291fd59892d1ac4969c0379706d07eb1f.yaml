        non-gateway mode.  In this mode, a datagram arriving through one
        interface will not be forwarded to another host or gateway (unless
        it is source-routed), regardless of whether the host is single-
        homed or multihomed.  The host software MUST NOT automatically
        move into gateway mode if the host has more than one interface, as
        the operator of the machine may neither want to provide that
        service nor be competent to do so.
