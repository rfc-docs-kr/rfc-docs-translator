          Again, Routers RT5 and RT7 are AS boundary routers.  Routers
          RT3, RT4, RT7, RT10 and RT11 are area border routers.  Note that
          there are two routing entries for the area border router RT3,
          since it has two areas in common with RT4 (Area 1 and the
          backbone).
