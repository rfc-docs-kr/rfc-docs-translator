     The digital signature algorithm that is used, is determined by the
     Live Signature Algorithm protocol option, see Section 7.7.  The
     signature is computed over a concatenation of the on-the-wire
     representation of the chunk specification, a 64-bit timestamp in NTP
     Timestamp format [RFC5905], and the chunk, in that order.  The
     timestamp is the time signature that was made at the injector in UTC.

  사용되는 디지털 서명 알고리즘은 라이브 서명 알고리즘 프로토콜 옵션에 의해 결정됩니다(섹션 7.7 참조). 서명은 청크 사양의 전송 중 표현, NTP 타임스탬프 형식[RFC5905]의 64비트 타임스탬프 및 청크를 순서대로 연결하여 계산됩니다. 타임스탬프는 인젝터에서 UTC로 작성된 박자표입니다.
