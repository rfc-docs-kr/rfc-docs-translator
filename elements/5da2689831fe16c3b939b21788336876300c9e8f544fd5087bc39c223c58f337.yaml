     For example, upon failure of authentication, some PPP implementations
     do not terminate the link, instead limiting traffic in Network-Layer
     Protocols to a filtered subset, which in turn allows the peer the
     opportunity to update secrets or send mail to the network
     administrator indicating a problem.  Similarly, while an
     authentication failure will result in denied access to the controlled
     port in [IEEE-802.1X], limited traffic may be permitted on the
     uncontrolled port.
