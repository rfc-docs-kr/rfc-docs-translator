              The link-state database is pieced together from LSAs
              generated by the routers.  In the associated graphical
              representation, the neighborhood of each router or transit
              network is represented in a single, separate LSA.  Figure 4
              shows these LSAs graphically. Router RT12 has an interface
              to two broadcast networks and a SLIP line to a host.
              Network N6 is a broadcast network with three attached
              routers.  The cost of all links from Network N6 to its
              attached routers is 0.  Note that the LSA for Network N6 is
              actually generated by one of the network's attached routers:
              the router that has been elected Designated Router for the
              network.
