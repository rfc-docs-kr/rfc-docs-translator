     A classifier consists of classifier elements.  A classifier element
     identifies a specific set of traffic that forms part of a behavior
     aggregate; other classifier elements within the same classifier may
     identify other traffic that also falls into the behavior aggregate.
     For example, in identifying AF traffic for the aggregate AF1, one
     might implement separate classifier elements for AF11, AF12, and AF13
     within the same classifier and pointing to the same subsequent meter.
