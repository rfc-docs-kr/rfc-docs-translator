     The framing defined in RFC 4571 MUST be used when receiving media.
     For media streams that are not RTP-based and do not normally use RFC
     4571, the agent extracts the payload of each RFC 4571 frame and
     determines if it is a STUN or an application-layer data based on the
     procedures in ICE [RFC5245].  If media is being protected with DTLS-
     SRTP, the DTLS, RTP, and STUN packets are demultiplexed as described
     in Section 5.1.2 of [RFC5764].
