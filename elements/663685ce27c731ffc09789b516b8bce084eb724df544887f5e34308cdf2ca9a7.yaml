     The AAA-Key is derived from the keying material exported by the EAP
     method (MSK and EMSK).  This derivation occurs on the AAA server.  In
     many existing protocols that use EAP, the AAA-Key and MSK are
     equivalent, but more complicated mechanisms are possible (see
     [KEYFRAME] for details).
