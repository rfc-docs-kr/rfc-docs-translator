     The ENABLE command is only valid in the authenticated state, before
     any mailbox is selected.  Clients MUST NOT issue ENABLE once they
     SELECT/EXAMINE a mailbox; however, server implementations don't have
     to check that no mailbox is selected or was previously selected
     during the duration of a connection.

  ENABLE 명령은 사서함을 선택하기 전의 인증된 상태에서만 유효합니다.  클라이언트는 메일함을 선택/검사한 후에는 ENABLE을 발행해서는 안 됩니다. 그러나 서버 구현에서는 연결된 사서함이 선택되지 않았는지 또는 연결 기간 동안 이전에 선택되었는지 확인할 필요가 없습니다.
