               complete with a Completion-Cause code of "partial-match-
               maxtime", unless the recognizer cannot differentiate a
               partial-match, in which case it MUST complete with a
               Completion-Cause code of "no-match-maxtime".  The
               recognizer MAY return results for the partially matched
               grammar.
