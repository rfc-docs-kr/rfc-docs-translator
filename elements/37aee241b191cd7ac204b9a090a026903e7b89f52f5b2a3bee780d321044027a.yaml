     When a service makes use of the authentication and/or authorization
     portion of an application, and a user requests access to the network,
     the Diameter client issues an auth request to its local server.  The
     auth request is defined in a service-specific Diameter application
     (e.g., NASREQ).  The request contains a Session-Id AVP, which is used
     in subsequent messages (e.g., subsequent authorization, accounting,
     etc.) relating to the user's session.  The Session-Id AVP is a means
     for the client and servers to correlate a Diameter message with a
     user session.
