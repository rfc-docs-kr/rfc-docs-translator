     The flexible scheme meant that it was possible for clients to express
     priorities in very different ways, with little consistency in the
     approaches that were adopted.  For servers, implementing generic
     support for the scheme was complex.  Implementation of priorities was
     uneven in both clients and servers.  Many server deployments ignored
     client signals when prioritizing their handling of requests.

  유연한 계획은 고객이 채택된 접근 방식의 일관성이 거의 없이 매우 다양한 방식으로 우선순위를 표현할 수 있음을 의미했습니다. 서버의 경우 체계에 대한 일반 지원을 구현하는 것이 복잡했습니다. 클라이언트와 서버 모두에서 우선순위 구현이 고르지 않았습니다. 많은 서버 배포에서는 요청 처리의 우선순위를 정할 때 클라이언트 신호를 무시했습니다.
