     The format of the SRH draws from that of the Type 0 Routing header
     (RH0) [RFC2460].  However, the SRH introduces mechanisms to compact
     the source route entries when all entries share the same prefix with
     the IPv6 Destination Address of a packet carrying an SRH, a typical
     scenario in LLNs using source routing.  The compaction mechanism
     reduces consumption of scarce resources such as channel capacity.
