     Section 5 discusses various security policies that may be deployed.
     The threats in Section 2 are mitigated only if both the transport
     sender and transport receiver are properly authenticated and
     authorized, as described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2.  These are the
     RECOMMENDED configurations for a default policy.
