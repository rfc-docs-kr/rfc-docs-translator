          AS boundary routers
              A router that exchanges routing information with routers
              belonging to other Autonomous Systems.  Such a router
              advertises AS external routing information throughout the
              Autonomous System.  The paths to each AS boundary router are
              known by every router in the AS.  This classification is
              completely independent of the previous classifications: AS
              boundary routers may be internal or area border routers, and
              may or may not participate in the backbone.
