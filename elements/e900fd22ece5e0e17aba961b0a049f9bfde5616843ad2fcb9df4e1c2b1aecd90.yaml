     The protocol can be used to (implicitly) create Contexts and modify
     the parameter values of existing Contexts.  The protocol has commands
     to add Terminations to Contexts, subtract them from Contexts, and to
     move Terminations between Contexts.  Contexts are deleted implicitly
     when the last remaining Termination is subtracted or moved out.
