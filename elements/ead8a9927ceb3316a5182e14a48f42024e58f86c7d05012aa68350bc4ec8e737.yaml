          The precise procedure for sending Link State Acknowledgment
          packets is described in Table 19.  The circumstances surrounding
          the receipt of the LSA are listed in the left column.  The
          acknowledgment action then taken is listed in one of the two
          right columns.  This action depends on the state of the
          concerned interface; interfaces in state Backup behave
          differently from interfaces in all other states.  Delayed
          acknowledgments must be delivered to all adjacent routers
          associated with the interface.  On broadcast networks, this is
          accomplished by sending the delayed Link State Acknowledgment
          packets as multicasts.  The Destination IP address used depends
