          This calculation yields the set of intra-area routes associated
          with an area (called hereafter Area A).  A router calculates the
          shortest-path tree using itself as the root.[22] The formation
          of the shortest path tree is done here in two stages.  In the
          first stage, only links between routers and transit networks are
          considered.  Using the Dijkstra algorithm, a tree is formed from
          this subset of the link state database.  In the second stage,
          leaves are added to the tree by considering the links to stub
          networks.
