     Similarly, the SCCP instance in an SGP can perform the SCCP GTT
     service for messages logically addressed to it from SCCP peers in the
     IP domain.  In this case, MTP-TRANSFER indication primitives are sent
     from the local M3UA-resident network address translation and mapping
     function to the SCCP for GTT.  If the result of the GTT yields the
     address of an SCCP peer in the SS7 network, then the resulting MTP-
     TRANSFER request primitive is given to the MTP3 for delivery to an
     SS7-resident node.
