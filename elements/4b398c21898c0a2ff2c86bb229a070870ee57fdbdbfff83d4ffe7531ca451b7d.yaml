             Action:  The (possibly partially formed) adjacency is torn
                      down, and then an attempt is made at
                      reestablishment.  The neighbor state first
                      transitions to ExStart.  The Link state
                      retransmission list, Database summary list and Link
                      state request list are cleared of LSAs.  Then the
                      router increments the DD sequence number in the
                      neighbor data structure, declares itself master
                      (sets the master/slave bit to master), and starts
                      sending Database Description Packets, with the
                      initialize (I), more (M) and master (MS) bits set.
                      This Database Description Packet should be otherwise
                      empty (see Section 10.8).
