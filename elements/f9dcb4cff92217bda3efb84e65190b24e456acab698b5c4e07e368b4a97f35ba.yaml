     The SRH MUST NOT specify a path that visits a node more than once.
     When generating an SRH, the source may not know the mapping between
     IPv6 addresses and nodes.  Minimally, the source MUST ensure that
     IPv6 addresses do not appear more than once and the IPv6 Source and
     Destination addresses of the encapsulating datagram do not appear in
     the SRH.
