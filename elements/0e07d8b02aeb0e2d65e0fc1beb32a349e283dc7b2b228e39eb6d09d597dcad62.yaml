     Methods supporting key derivation MUST demonstrate cryptographic
     separation between the MSK and EMSK branches of the EAP key
     hierarchy.  Without violating a fundamental cryptographic assumption
     (such as the non-invertibility of a one-way function), an attacker
     recovering the MSK or EMSK MUST NOT be able to recover the other
     quantity with a level of effort less than brute force.
