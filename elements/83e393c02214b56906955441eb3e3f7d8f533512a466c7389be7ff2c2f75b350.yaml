        all the subscribers into groups, such that traffic destined to all
        the subscribers within a group should flow through a particular
        attachment point. Once the partitioning is done, the address space
        of the provider is subdivided along the group boundaries. A leaf
        routing domain that is willing to accept prefixes derived from its
        direct provider gets a prefix from the provider's address space
        subdivision associated with the group the domain belongs to. Note
        that the advertisement by the direct provider of the routing
        information associated with each subdivision must be done with
        care to ensure that such an advertisement would not result in a
        global distribution of separate reachability information
        associated with each subdivision, unless such distribution is
        warranted for some other purposes (e.g., supporting certain
        aspects of policy-based routing).
