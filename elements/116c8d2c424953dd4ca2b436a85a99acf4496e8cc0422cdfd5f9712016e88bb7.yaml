      DESCRIPTION
         "The minimum rate that a downstream scheduler element should
         allocate to this queue, relative to the maximum rate of the
         interface as reported by ifSpeed or ifHighSpeed, in units of
         1/1000 of 1. If the value is zero, then there is effectively no
         minimum rate guarantee. If the value is non-zero, the scheduler
         will assure the servicing of this queue to at least this rate.
