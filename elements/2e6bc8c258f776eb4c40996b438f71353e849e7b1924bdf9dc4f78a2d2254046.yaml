     An Application Server Process may be configured to process signalling
     traffic related to more than one Application Server, over a single
     SCTP Association.  In ASP Active and ASP Inactive management
     messages, the signalling traffic to be started or stopped is
     discriminated by the Routing Context parameter.  At an ASP, the
     Routing Context parameter uniquely identifies the range of signalling
     traffic associated with each Application Server that the ASP is
     configured to receive.
