          In order to avoid key reuse, the AAA layer MUST delete
          transported keys once they are sent.  The AAA layer MUST NOT
          retain keys that it has previously sent.  For example, a AAA
          layer that has transported the MSK MUST delete it, and keys MUST
          NOT be derived from the MSK from that point forward.

  - 키 재사용을 피하기 위해 AAA 계층은 전송된 키가 전송된 후 삭제해야 합니다. AAA 계층은 이전에 보낸 키를 보관해서는 안 됩니다. 예를 들어, MSK를 전송한 AAA 계층은 이를 삭제해야 하며(MUST) 해당 시점부터 MSK에서 키가 파생되어서는 안 됩니다(MUST NOT).
