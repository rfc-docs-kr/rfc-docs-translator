              A TCP SHOULD implement the Nagle Algorithm [TCP:9] to
              coalesce short segments.  However, there MUST be a way for
              an application to disable the Nagle algorithm on an
              individual connection.  In all cases, sending data is also
              subject to the limitation imposed by the Slow Start
              algorithm (Section 4.2.2.15).
