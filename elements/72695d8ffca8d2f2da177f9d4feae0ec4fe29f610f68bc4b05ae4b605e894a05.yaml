          A virtual link is defined by the following two configurable
          parameters: the Router ID of the virtual link's other endpoint,
          and the (non-backbone) area through which the virtual link runs
          (referred to as the virtual link's Transit area).  Virtual links
          cannot be configured through stub areas.
