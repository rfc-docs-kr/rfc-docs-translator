     For SS7 user part management, it is required that the MTP3-User
     protocols at ASPs receive indications of SS7 signalling point
     availability, SS7 network congestion, and remote User Part
     unavailability, as would be expected in an SS7 SEP node.  To
     accomplish this, the MTP-PAUSE, MTP-RESUME, and MTP-STATUS indication
     primitives received at the MTP3 upper layer interface at the SG need
     to be propagated to the remote MTP3-User lower layer interface at the
     ASP.
