              * Is "teletype-like", i.e.:
                 - ASCII characters are transmitted;
                 - Echoes are generated by the remote HOST;
                 - The receiving HOST[s] scan for break characters;
                 - The transmission rate is slow (less than 20
                 characters/sec).
