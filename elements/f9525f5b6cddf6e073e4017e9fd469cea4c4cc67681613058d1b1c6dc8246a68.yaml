     limited to a simple echo function.  However, the most common facility
     for round-trip measurements is the ICMP Echo Request/Reply (used by
     the ping tool), and issues with this method are documented in Section
     2.6 of [RFC2681].  This memo specifies the Two-Way Active Measurement
     Protocol, or TWAMP.  TWAMP uses the methodology and architecture of
     OWAMP [RFC4656] to define an open protocol for measurement of two-way
     or round-trip metrics (henceforth in this document the term two-way
     also signifies round-trip), in addition to the one-way metrics of
     OWAMP.  TWAMP employs time stamps applied at the echo destination
     (reflector) to enable greater accuracy (processing delays can be
     accounted for).  The TWAMP measurement architecture is usually
     comprised of only two hosts with specific roles, and this allows for
     some protocol simplifications, making it an attractive alternative to
     OWAMP in some circumstances.
