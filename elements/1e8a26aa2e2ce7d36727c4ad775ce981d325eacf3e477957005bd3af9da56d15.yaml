              DISCUSSION:
                   One important performance issue is "Silly Window
                   Syndrome" or "SWS" [TCP:5], a stable pattern of small
                   incremental window movements resulting in extremely
                   poor TCP performance.  Algorithms to avoid SWS are
                   described below for both the sending side (Section
                   4.2.3.4) and the receiving side (Section 4.2.3.3).
