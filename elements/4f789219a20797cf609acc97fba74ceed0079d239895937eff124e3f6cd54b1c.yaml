     Description:  This option tag indicates support for the Security
                   Agreement mechanism.  When used in the Require, or
                   Proxy-Require headers, it indicates that proxy servers
                   are required to use the Security Agreement mechanism.
                   When used in the Supported header, it indicates that
                   the User Agent Client supports the Security Agreement
                   mechanism.  When used in the Require header in the 494
                   (Security Agreement Required) or 421 (Extension
                   Required) responses, it indicates that the User Agent
                   Client must use the Security Agreement Mechanism.
