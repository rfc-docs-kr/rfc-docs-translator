          signatureAlgorithm identifies the signature algorithm (and any
            associated parameters) under which the certification-request
            information is signed.  For example, a specification might
            include an ALGORITHM object for PKCS #1's
            md5WithRSAEncryption in the information object set
            SignatureAlgorithms:
