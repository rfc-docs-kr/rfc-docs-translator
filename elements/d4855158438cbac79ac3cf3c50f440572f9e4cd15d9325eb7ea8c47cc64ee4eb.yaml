     Three ranges of the type field are currently defined. Types 0-63 are
     reserved as fixed, well-known mappings to be defined by this document
     and future revisions of this document. Types 64-127 are the same as
     types 0-63, except that restart markers are present in the JPEG data
     and a Restart Marker header appears immediately following the main
     JPEG header. Types 128-255 are free to be dynamically defined by a
     session setup protocol (which is beyond the scope of this document).
