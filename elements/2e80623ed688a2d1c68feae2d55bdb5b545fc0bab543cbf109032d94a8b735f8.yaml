     Diameter peers acting as clients MUST implement the use of failover
     to guard against server failures and certain network failures.
     Diameter peers acting as agents or related off-line processing
     systems MUST detect duplicate accounting records caused by the
     sending of the same record to several servers and duplication of
     messages in transit.  This detection MUST be based on the inspection
     of the Session-Id and Accounting-Record-Number AVP pairs.  Appendix C
     discusses duplicate detection needs and implementation issues.
