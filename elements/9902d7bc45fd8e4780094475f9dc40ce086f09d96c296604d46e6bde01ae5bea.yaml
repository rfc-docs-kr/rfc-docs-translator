     Syslog messages may transit several hops to arrive at the intended
     collector.  Some intermediary networks may not be trusted by the
     originator, relay, or receiver because the network is in a different
     security domain or at a different security level from the originator,
     relay, or collector.  Another security concern is that the
     originator, relay, or receiver itself is in an insecure network.
