     If a response is received to any reachability test or DHCP message,
     pending retransmissions are canceled.  It is RECOMMENDED that a DNAv4
     implementation retransmit no more than twice.  To provide damping in
     the case of spurious "Link Up" indications, it is RECOMMENDED that
     the DNAv4 procedure be carried out no more than once a second.
