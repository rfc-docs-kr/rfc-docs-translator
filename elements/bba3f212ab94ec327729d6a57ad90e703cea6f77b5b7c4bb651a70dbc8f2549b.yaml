     Delegated credentials can be valid for 7 days (by default), and it is
     much easier for a service to create delegated credentials than a
     certificate signed by a CA.  A service could determine the client
     time and clock skew by creating several delegated credentials with
     different expiry timestamps and observing which credentials the
     client accepts.  Since client time can be unique to a particular
     client, privacy-sensitive clients who do not trust the service, such
     as browsers in incognito mode, might not want to advertise support
     for delegated credentials, or might limit the number of probes that a
     server can perform.
