     NAT devices (without the inclusion of ALGs) do not examine or modify
     transport payload. For this reason, NAT devices are transparent to
     applications in many cases. There are two areas, however, where NAT
     devices often cause difficulties: 1) when an application payload
     includes an IP address, and 2) when end-to-end security is needed.
     Note, this is not a comprehensive list.
