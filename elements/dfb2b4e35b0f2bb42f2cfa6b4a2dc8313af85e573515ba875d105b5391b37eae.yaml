     The organizational separation between operators of TLS and DTLS
     endpoints and the certification authority can create limitations.
     For example, the lifetime of certificates, how they may be used, and
     the algorithms they support are ultimately determined by the
     Certification Authority (CA).  This document describes a mechanism to
     overcome some of these limitations by enabling operators to delegate
     their own credentials for use in TLS and DTLS without breaking
     compatibility with peers that do not support this specification.
