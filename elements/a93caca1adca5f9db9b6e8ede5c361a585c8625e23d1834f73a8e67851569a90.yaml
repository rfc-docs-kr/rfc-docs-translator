          (3) Look up the routing table entry for N. (If N is an AS
              boundary router, look up the "router" routing table entry
              associated with the backbone area). If it does not exist, or
              if the route type is other than intra-area or inter-area, or
              if the area associated with the routing table entry is not
              the backbone area, then examine the next LSA. In other
              words, this calculation only updates backbone intra-area
              routes found in Section 16.1 and inter-area routes found in
              Section 16.2.
