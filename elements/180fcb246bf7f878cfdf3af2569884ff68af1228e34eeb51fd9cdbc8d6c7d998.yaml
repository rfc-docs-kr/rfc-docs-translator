     Diameter messages containing these or any other AVPs considered to be
     security-sensitive MUST only be sent protected via mutually
     authenticated TLS or IPsec.  In addition, those messages MUST NOT be
     sent via intermediate nodes unless there is end-to-end security
     between the originator and recipient or the originator has locally
     trusted configuration that indicates that end-to-end security is not
     needed.  For example, end-to-end security may not be required in the
     case where an intermediary node is known to be operated as part of
     the same administrative domain as the endpoints so that an ability to
     successfully compromise the intermediary would imply a high
     probability of being able to compromise the endpoints as well.  Note
     that no end-to-end security mechanism is specified in this document.
