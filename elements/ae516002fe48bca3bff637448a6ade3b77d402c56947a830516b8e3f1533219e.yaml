     To give transactional semantics, the same steps used in single-device
     operations listed above are used, but are performed in parallel
     across all devices.  Configuration locks should be acquired on all
     target devices and kept until all devices are updated and the changes
     made permanent.  Configuration changes should be uploaded and
     validation performed across all devices.  Checkpoints should be made
     on each device.  Then the running configuration can be changed,
     tested, and made permanent.  If any of these steps fail, the previous
     configurations can be restored on any devices upon which they were
     changed.  After the changes have been completely implemented or
     completely discarded, the locks on each device can be released.
