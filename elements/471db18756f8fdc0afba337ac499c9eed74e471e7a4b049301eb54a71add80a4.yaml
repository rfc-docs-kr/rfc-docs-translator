     If an SGP determines that a received Routing Key does not currently
     exist, and the SGP supports dynamic configuration but requires that
     the Routing Key first be manually provisioned at the SGP, the SGP
     returns a Registration Response message to the ASP, containing a
     Registration Result "Error - Routing Key not Currently Provisioned".
