     There are multiple namespaces.  Vendors can have their own AVP Codes
     namespace that will be identified by their Vendor-ID (also known as
     Enterprise-Number), and they control the assignments of their vendor-
     specific AVP Codes within their own namespace.  The absence of a
     Vendor-ID or a Vendor-ID value of zero (0) identifies the IETF AVP
     Codes namespace, which is under IANA control.  The AVP Codes and
     sometimes possible values in an AVP are controlled and maintained by
     IANA.  AVP Code 0 is not used.  AVP Codes 1-255 are managed
     separately as RADIUS Attribute Types.  Where a Vendor-Specific AVP is
     implemented by more than one vendor, allocation of global AVPs should
     be encouraged instead.
