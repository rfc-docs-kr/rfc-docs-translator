     For TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP usage, a TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP handshake
     SHOULD begin when both ends are in the closed state prior to any
     Diameter message exchanges.  The TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP connection
     SHOULD be established before sending any CER or CEA message to secure
     and protect the capabilities information of both peers.  The TLS/TCP
     and DTLS/SCTP connection SHOULD be disconnected when the state
     machine moves to the closed state.  When connecting to responders
     that do not conform to this document (i.e., older Diameter
     implementations that are not prepared to received TLS/TCP and DTLS/
     SCTP connections in the closed state), the initial TLS/TCP and DTLS/
     SCTP connection attempt will fail.  The initiator MAY then attempt to
     connect via TCP or SCTP and initiate the TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP
     handshake when both ends are in the open state.  If the handshake is
     successful, all further messages will be sent via TLS/TCP and DTLS/
     SCTP.  If the handshake fails, both ends move to the closed state.
