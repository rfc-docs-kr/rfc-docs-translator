     1.  Exhaustion of the Class B network address space.  One fundamental
         cause of this problem is the lack of a network class of a size
         that is appropriate for mid-sized organization.  Class C, with a
         maximum of 254 host addresses, is too small, whereas Class B,
         which allows up to 65534 host addresses, is too large for most
         organizations but was the best fit available for use with
         subnetting.
