     The client's view of the age of a ticket is the time since the
     receipt of the NewSessionTicket message.  Clients MUST NOT attempt to
     use tickets which have ages greater than the "ticket_lifetime" value
     which was provided with the ticket.  The "obfuscated_ticket_age"
     field of each PskIdentity contains an obfuscated version of the
     ticket age formed by taking the age in milliseconds and adding the
     "ticket_age_add" value that was included with the ticket (see
     Section 4.6.1), modulo 2^32.  This addition prevents passive
     observers from correlating connections unless tickets are reused.
     Note that the "ticket_lifetime" field in the NewSessionTicket message
     is in seconds but the "obfuscated_ticket_age" is in milliseconds.
     Because ticket lifetimes are restricted to a week, 32 bits is enough
     to represent any plausible age, even in milliseconds.

  클라이언트가 보는 티켓 기간은 NewSessionTicket 메시지를 받은 이후의 시간입니다. 클라이언트는 티켓과 함께 제공된 "ticket_lifetime" 값보다 오래 지속되는 티켓을 사용하려고 시도해서는 안 됩니다. 각 PskIdentity의 "obfuscated_ticket_age" 필드에는 밀리초 단위의 기간을 취하고 티켓에 포함된 "ticket_age_add" 값(섹션 4.6.1 참조)을 모듈로 2^32로 추가하여 형성된 티켓 기간의 난독화된 버전이 포함되어 있습니다. 이렇게 추가하면 티켓이 재사용되지 않는 한 수동적 관찰자가 연결을 연관시키는 것을 방지할 수 있습니다. NewSessionTicket 메시지의 "ticket_lifetime" 필드는 초 단위이지만 "obfuscated_ticket_age"는 밀리초 단위입니다. 티켓 수명은 일주일로 제한되어 있으므로 32비트이면 모든 가능한 연령을 밀리초 단위로 표현하는 데 충분합니다.
