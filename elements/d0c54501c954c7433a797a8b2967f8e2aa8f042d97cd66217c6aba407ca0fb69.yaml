     The alternative mechanism specified by this document applies when a
     host has a previously allocated DHCP address, which was not returned
     to the DHCP server via a DHCPRELEASE message, and which still has
     time remaining on its lease.  In this case, the host may determine
     whether it has re-attached to the logical link where this address is
     valid for use, by sending a unicast ARP Request packet to a router
     previously known for that link (or, in the case of a link with more
     than one router, by sending one or more unicast ARP Request packets
     to one or more of those routers).
