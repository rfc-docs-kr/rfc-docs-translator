      Database Description packets are OSPF packet type 2.  These packets
      are exchanged when an adjacency is being initialized.  They describe
      the contents of the link-state database.  Multiple packets may be
      used to describe the database.  For this purpose a poll-response
      procedure is used.  One of the routers is designated to be the
      master, the other the slave.  The master sends Database Description
      packets (polls) which are acknowledged by Database Description
      packets sent by the slave (responses).  The responses are linked to
      the polls via the packets' DD sequence numbers.
