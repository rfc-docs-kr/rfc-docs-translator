        A Vendor-ID value of zero (0) corresponds to the IETF-adopted AVP
        values, as managed by IANA.  Since the absence of the Vendor-ID
        field implies that the AVP in question is not vendor specific,
        implementations MUST NOT use the value of zero (0) for the
        Vendor-ID field.
