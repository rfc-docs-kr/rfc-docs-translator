     A particular value of Accounting-Sub-Session-Id MUST appear only in
     one sequence of accounting records from a Diameter client, except for
     the purposes of retransmission.  The one sequence that is sent MUST
     be either one record with Accounting-Record-Type AVP set to the value
     EVENT_RECORD or several records starting with one having the value
     START_RECORD, followed by zero or more INTERIM_RECORDs and a single
     STOP_RECORD.  A particular Diameter application specification MUST
     define the type of sequences that MUST be used.
