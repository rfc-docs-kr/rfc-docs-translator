     The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES -- [FIPS-197]) has become the
     gold standard in encryption.  Its efficient design, widespread
     implementation, and hardware support allow for high performance in
     many areas.  On most modern platforms, AES is anywhere from four to
     ten times as fast as the previous most-used cipher, Triple Data
     Encryption Standard (3DES -- [SP800-67]), which makes it not only the
     best choice, but the only practical choice.
