     [a] In order to avoid synchronization behaviors that can occur with
         fixed timers among distributed systems, the retransmission timer
         is calculated with a jitter by using the RTO value and randomly
         adding a value drawn between -RTOmin/2 and RTOmin/2.  Alternative
         calculations to create jitter MAY be used.  These MUST be
         pseudo-random.  For a discussion of pseudo-random number
         generation, see [RFC1750].
