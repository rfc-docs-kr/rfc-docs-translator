     This coordination can be achieved in multiple ways.  The DAC may be
     co-located with a RADIUS server, in which case it is presumed to have
     access to the necessary data.  The RADIUS server may also store that
     information in a common database.  The DAC can then be separated from
     the RADIUS server, so long as it has access to that common database.
