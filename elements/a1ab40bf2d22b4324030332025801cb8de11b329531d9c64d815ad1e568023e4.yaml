        Relays forward requests and responses based on routing-related
        AVPs and routing table entries.  Since relays do not make policy
        decisions, they do not examine or alter non-routing AVPs.  As a
        result, relays never originate messages, do not need to understand
        the semantics of messages or non-routing AVPs, and are capable of
        handling any Diameter application or message type.  Since relays
        make decisions based on information in routing AVPs and realm
        forwarding tables, they do not keep state on NAS resource usage or
        sessions in progress.
