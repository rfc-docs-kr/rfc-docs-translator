              The directed graph resulting from the map in Figure 2 is
              depicted in Figure 3.  Arcs are labelled with the cost of
              the corresponding router output interface.  Arcs having no
              labelled cost have a cost of 0.  Note that arcs leading from
              networks to routers always have cost 0; they are significant
              nonetheless.  Note also that the externally derived routing
              data appears on the graph as stubs.
