     TLS allows the definition of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DH) and
     Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman parameters in its respective key
     exchange modes.  This results in an attack detailed in
     [Cross-Protocol].  Using predefined DH groups, as proposed in
     [FFDHE-TLS], would mitigate this attack.
