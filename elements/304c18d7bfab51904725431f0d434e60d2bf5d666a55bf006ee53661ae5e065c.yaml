              Finally, we note another possibility that is NOT
              multihoming:  one logical interface may be bound to multiple
              physical interfaces, in order to increase the reliability or
              throughput between directly connected machines by providing
              alternative physical paths between them.  For instance, two
              systems might be connected by multiple point-to-point links.
              We call this "link-layer multiplexing".  With link-layer
              multiplexing, the protocols above the link layer are unaware
              that multiple physical interfaces are present; the link-
              layer device driver is responsible for multiplexing and
              routing packets across the physical interfaces.
