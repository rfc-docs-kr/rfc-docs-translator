           The enormous growth of the Internet has revealed problems of
           management and scaling in a large datagram-based packet
           communication system.  These problems are being addressed, and
           as a result there will be continuing evolution of the
           specifications described in this document.  These changes will
           be carefully planned and controlled, since there is extensive
           participation in this planning by the vendors and by the
           organizations responsible for operations of the networks.
