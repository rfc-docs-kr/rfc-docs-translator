     Like its UDP counterparts, TCP-based STUN transactions are paced out
     at one every Ta milliseconds (see Section 16 of [RFC5245]).  This
     pacing refers strictly to STUN transactions (both Binding and
     Allocate requests).  If performance of the transaction requires
     establishment of a TCP connection, then the connection gets opened
     when the transaction is performed.
