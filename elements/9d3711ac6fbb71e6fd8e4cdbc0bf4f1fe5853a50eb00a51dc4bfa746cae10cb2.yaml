      The rest of the packet consists of a (possibly partial) list of the
      link-state database's pieces.  Each LSA in the database is described
      by its LSA header.  The LSA header is documented in Section A.4.1.
      It contains all the information required to uniquely identify both
      the LSA and the LSA's current instance.
