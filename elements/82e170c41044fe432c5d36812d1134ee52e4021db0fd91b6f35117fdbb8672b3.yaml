     The Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP (AVP Code 483) is of type
     Enumerated and is sent from the Diameter home authorization server to
     the Diameter client or in the Accounting-Answer from the accounting
     server.  The client uses information in this AVP to decide what to do
     if the sending of accounting records to the accounting server has
     been temporarily prevented due to, for instance, a network problem.
