     The TWAMP-Test HMAC Session-key is obtained as follows: the TWAMP-
     Control HMAC Session-key (the same HMAC Session-key as used for the
     corresponding TWAMP-Control session) is encrypted using AES-CBC
     (Cipher Block Chaining) with the 16-octet session identifier (SID) as
     the key.  This is a two-block CBC encryption that is always performed
     with IV=0.  Note that the TWAMP-Test HMAC Session-key and TWAMP-
     Control HMAC Session-key are comprised of 32 octets, while the SID is
     16 octets.
