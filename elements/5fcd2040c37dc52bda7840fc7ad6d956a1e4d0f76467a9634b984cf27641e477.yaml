     A common type of meter is a Token Bucket meter, such as [srTCM] or
     [trTCM].  This type of meter assumes the use of a shaper at a
     previous node; applications which send at a constant rate when
     sending may conform if the token bucket is properly specified.  It
     specifies the acceptable arrival rate and quantifies the acceptable
     variability, often by specifying a burst size or an interval; since
     rate = quantity/time, specifying any two of those parameters implies
     the third, and a large interval provides for a forgiving system.
     Multiple rates may be specified, as in AF, such that a subset of the
     traffic (up to one rate) is accepted with one set of guarantees, and
     traffic in excess of that but below another rate has a different set
     of guarantees.  Other types of meters exist as well.
