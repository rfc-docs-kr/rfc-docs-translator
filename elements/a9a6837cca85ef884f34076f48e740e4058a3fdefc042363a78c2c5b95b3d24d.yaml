        o    Organizations which change service provider but do not
             renumber. This has the effect of "punching a hole" in the
             aggregation of the original service provider's advertisement.
             This plan will handle the situation by requiring the newer
             service provider to advertise a specific advertisement for
             the new client, which is preferred by virtue of being the
             longest match.  To maintain efficiency of aggregation, it is
             recommended that organizations which do change service
             providers plan to eventually migrate their address
             assignments from the old provider's space to that of the new
             provider. To this end, it is recommended that mechanisms to
             facilitate such migration, including improved protocols and
             procedures for dynamic host address assignment, be developed.
