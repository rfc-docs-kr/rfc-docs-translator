        (d)  explicit_policy:  an integer that indicates if a non-NULL
             valid_policy_tree is required.  The integer indicates the
             number of non-self-issued certificates to be processed before
             this requirement is imposed.  Once set, this variable may be
             decreased, but may not be increased.  That is, if a
             certificate in the path requires a non-NULL
             valid_policy_tree, a later certificate cannot remove this
             requirement.  If initial-explicit-policy is set, then the
             initial value is 0, otherwise the initial value is n+1.
