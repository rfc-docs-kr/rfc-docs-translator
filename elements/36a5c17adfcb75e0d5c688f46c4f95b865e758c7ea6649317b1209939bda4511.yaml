     The degree to which a relying party can trust the binding embodied in
     a certificate depends on several factors.  These factors can include
     the practices followed by the certification authority (CA) in
     authenticating the subject; the CA's operating policy, procedures,
     and technical security controls, including the scope of the
     subscriber's responsibilities (for example, in protecting the private
     key), and the stated responsibilities and liability terms and
     conditions of the CA (for example, warranties, disclaimers of
     warranties, and limitations of liability).
