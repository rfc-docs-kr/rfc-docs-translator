     Mutual authentication
        This refers to an EAP method in which, within an interlocked
        exchange, the authenticator authenticates the peer and the peer
        authenticates the authenticator.  Two independent one-way methods,
        running in opposite directions do not provide mutual
        authentication as defined here.
