     This example shows an architecture where no Signalling Gateway is
     used.  In this example, SCCP messages are exchanged directly between
     two IP-resident IPSPs with resident SCCP-User protocol instances,
     such as RANAP or TCAP.  SS7 network interworking is not required;
     therefore, there is no MTP3 network management status information for
     the SCCP and SCCP-User protocols to consider.  Any MTP-PAUSE, MTP-
     RESUME, or MTP-STATUS indications from the M3UA layer to the SCCP
     layer should consider the status of the SCTP Association and
     underlying IP network and any congestion information received from
     the remote site.
