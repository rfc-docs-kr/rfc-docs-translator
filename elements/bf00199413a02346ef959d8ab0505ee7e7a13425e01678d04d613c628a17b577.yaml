     The following diagram will be used as a base model to illustrate NAT
     flavors. Host-A, with address Addr-A is located in a private realm,
     represented by the network N-Pri. N-Pri is isolated from external
     network through a NAT router. Host-X, with address Addr-X is located
     in an external realm, represented by the network N-Ext.  NAT router
     with two interfaces, each attached to one of the realms provides
     transparent routing between the two realms. The interface to the
     external realm is assigned an address of Addr-Nx and the interface to
     private realm is assigned an address of Addr-Np.  Further, it may be
     understood that addresses Addr-A and Addr-Np correspond to N-Pri
     network and the addresses Addr-X and Addr-Nx correspond to N-Ext
     network.
