     In most cases, it is likely that the client will be using TLS because
     the server would refuse to interact insecurely.  To allow for this,
     clients SHOULD be flexible enough to manage the securing of a session
     at the appropriate time and still allow the user/server policies to
     dictate exactly when during the session the security is negotiated.
