                   (1)  Timeout -- Periodically time out cache entries,
                        even if they are in use.  Note that this timeout
                        should be restarted when the cache entry is
                        "refreshed" (by observing the source fields,
                        regardless of target address, of an ARP broadcast
                        from the system in question).  For proxy ARP
                        situations, the timeout needs to be on the order
                        of a minute.
