                   Note that the general effect of this algorithm is to
                   advance RCV.WND in increments of Eff.snd.MSS (for
                   realistic receive buffers:  Eff.snd.MSS < RCV.BUFF/2).
                   Note also that the receiver must use its own
                   Eff.snd.MSS, assuming it is the same as the sender's.
