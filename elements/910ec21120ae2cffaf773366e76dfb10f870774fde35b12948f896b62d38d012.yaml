      [6]On point-to-point networks, the lower level protocols indicate
      whether the neighbor is up and running.  Likewise, existence of the
      neighbor on virtual links is indicated by the routing table
      calculation.  However, in both these cases, the Hello Protocol is
      still used.  This ensures that communication between the neighbors
      is bidirectional, and that each of the neighbors has a functioning
      routing protocol layer.
