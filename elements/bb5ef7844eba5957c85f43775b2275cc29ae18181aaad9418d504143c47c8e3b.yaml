     A consequence of the MAC-then-encrypt design in all current versions
     of TLS is the existence of padding oracle attacks [Padding-Oracle].
     A recent incarnation of these attacks is the Lucky Thirteen attack
     (CVE-2013-0169) [CBC-Attack], a timing side-channel attack that
     allows the attacker to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext.
