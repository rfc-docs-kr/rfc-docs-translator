        The Notification Type is optionally used to convey a displayable
        message from the authenticator to the peer.  An authenticator MAY
        send a Notification Request to the peer at any time when there is
        no outstanding Request, prior to completion of an EAP
        authentication method.  The peer MUST respond to a Notification
        Request with a Notification Response unless the EAP authentication
        method specification prohibits the use of Notification messages.
        In any case, a Nak Response MUST NOT be sent in response to a
        Notification Request.  Note that the default maximum length of a
        Notification Request is 1020 octets.  By default, this leaves at
        most 1015 octets for the human readable message.
