     The designers of this MIB expect that every path through a policy
     should have a corresponding counter.  In early versions, it was
     impossible to configure an action without implementing a counter,
     although the current design makes them in effect the network
     manager's option, as a result of making actions consistent in
     structure and extensibility.  The assurance of proper debugging and
     accounting is therefore left with the policy designer.
