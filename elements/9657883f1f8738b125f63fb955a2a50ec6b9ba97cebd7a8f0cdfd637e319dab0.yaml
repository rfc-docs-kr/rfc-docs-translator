     In addition to authenticating each connection, the entire session
     MUST also be authorized.  Before initiating a connection, a Diameter
     peer MUST check that its peers are authorized to act in their roles.
     For example, a Diameter peer may be authentic, but that does not mean
     that it is authorized to act as a Diameter server advertising a set
     of Diameter applications.
