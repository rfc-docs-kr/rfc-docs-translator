     If T(r) expires before an ASP becomes ASP-ACTIVE, and the SGP has no
     alternative, the SGP may stop queuing messages and discard all
     previously queued messages.  The AS will move to the AS-INACTIVE
     state if at least one ASP is in ASP-INACTIVE; otherwise, it will move
     to AS-DOWN state.
