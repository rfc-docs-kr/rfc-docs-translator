     The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has completed a Proposed
     Standard for the round-trip delay [RFC2681] metric.  The IETF has
     also completed a protocol for the control and collection of one-way
     measurements, the One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP)
     [RFC4656].  However, OWAMP does not accommodate round-trip or two-way
     measurements.
