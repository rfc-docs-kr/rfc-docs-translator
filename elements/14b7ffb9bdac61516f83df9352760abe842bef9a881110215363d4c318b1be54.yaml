          Router-LSAs and network-LSAs
              The entire routing table must be recalculated, starting with
              the shortest path calculations for each area (not just the
              area whose link-state database has changed).  The reason
              that the shortest path calculation cannot be restricted to
              the single changed area has to do with the fact that AS
              boundary routers may belong to multiple areas.  A change in
              the area currently providing the best route may force the
              router to use an intra-area route provided by a different
              area.[19]
