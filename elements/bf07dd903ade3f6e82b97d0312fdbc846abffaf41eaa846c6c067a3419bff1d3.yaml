                  For virtual links, a link description is added to the
                  router-LSA only when the virtual neighbor is fully
                  adjacent. In this case, add a Type 4 link (virtual link)
                  with Link ID set to the Router ID of the virtual
                  neighbor, Link Data set to the IP interface address
                  associated with the virtual link and cost set to the
                  cost calculated for the virtual link during the routing
                  table calculation (see Section 15).
