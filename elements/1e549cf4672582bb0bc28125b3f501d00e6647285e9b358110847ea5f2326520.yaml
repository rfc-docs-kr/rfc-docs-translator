     traffic to a neighboring AS for forwarding to some destination
     (reachable through but) beyond that neighboring AS, intending that
     the traffic take a different route to that taken by the traffic
     originating in the neighboring AS (for that same destination).  On
     the other hand, BGP can support any policy conforming to the
     destination-based forwarding paradigm.

  트래픽이 인접 AS를 넘어 일부 대상(통해 도달 가능)으로 전달되도록 인접 AS로 트래픽을 전달하고, 해당 트래픽이 인접 AS에서 시작된 트래픽(동일한 대상에 대해)이 취한 경로와 다른 경로를 취하도록 의도합니다. 반면 BGP는 대상 기반 전달 패러다임을 준수하는 모든 정책을 지원할 수 있습니다.
