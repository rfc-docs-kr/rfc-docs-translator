              The Designated Router for the network originates the LSA.
              The Designated Router originates the LSA only if it is fully
              adjacent to at least one other router on the network.  The
              network-LSA is flooded throughout the area that contains the
              transit network, and no further.  The network-LSA lists
              those routers that are fully adjacent to the Designated
              Router; each fully adjacent router is identified by its OSPF
              Router ID.  The Designated Router includes itself in this
              list.
