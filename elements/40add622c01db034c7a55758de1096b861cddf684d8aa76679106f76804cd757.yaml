     The DAC may require access to data from RADIUS authentication or
     accounting packets.  It uses this data to compose compliant CoA-
     Request or Disconnect-Request packets.  For example, as described in
     Section 3.3, a CoA-Request packet containing a Service-Type Attribute
     with a value of "Authorize Only" is required to contain a State
     Attribute.  The NAS will subsequently transmit this attribute to the
     RADIUS server in an Access-Request.  In order for the DAC to include
     a State Attribute that the RADIUS server will subsequently accept,
     some coordination between the two parties may be required.
