     There are two different types of errors in Diameter; protocol errors
     and application errors.  A protocol error is one that occurs at the
     base protocol level and MAY require per-hop attention (e.g., a
     message routing error).  Application errors, on the other hand,
     generally occur due to a problem with a function specified in a
     Diameter application (e.g., user authentication, missing AVP).
