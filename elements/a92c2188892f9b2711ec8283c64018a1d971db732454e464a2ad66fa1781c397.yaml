     Executing some transactions may require a long time. Long execution
     times may interact with the timer based retransmission procedure.
     This may result either in an inordinate number of retransmissions,
     or in timer values that become too long to be efficient. Entities
     that can predict that a transaction will require a long execution
     time may send a provisional response, "Transaction Pending".  They
     SHOULD send this response if they receive a repetition of a
     transaction that is still being executed.
