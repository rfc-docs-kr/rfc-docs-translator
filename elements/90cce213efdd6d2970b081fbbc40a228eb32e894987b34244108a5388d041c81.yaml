      An LSA's LS age is never incremented past the value MaxAge.  LSAs
      having age MaxAge are not used in the routing table calculation.  As
      a router ages its link state database, an LSA's LS age may reach
      MaxAge.[21] At this time, the router must attempt to flush the LSA
      from the routing domain.  This is done simply by reflooding the
      MaxAge LSA just as if it was a newly originated LSA (see Section
      13.3).
