          The Autonomous System's link-state database describes a directed
          graph.  The vertices of the graph consist of routers and
          networks.  A graph edge connects two routers when they are
          attached via a physical point-to-point network.  An edge
          connecting a router to a network indicates that the router has
          an interface on the network. Networks can be either transit or
          stub networks. Transit networks are those capable of carrying
          data traffic that is neither locally originated nor locally
          destined. A transit network is represented by a graph vertex
          having both incoming and outgoing edges. A stub network's vertex
          has only incoming edges.
