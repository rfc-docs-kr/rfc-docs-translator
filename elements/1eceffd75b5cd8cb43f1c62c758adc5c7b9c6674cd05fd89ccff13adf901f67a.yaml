     Even when the protocol is properly specified, this does not guarantee
     the security of implementations.  In fact, there are very common
     issues that often plague TLS implementations.  In particular, when
     integrating into higher-level protocols, TLS and its PKI-based
     authentication are sometimes the source of misunderstandings and
     implementation "shortcuts".  An extensive survey of these issues can
     be found in [Georgiev2012].
