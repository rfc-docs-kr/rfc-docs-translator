          ExternalRoutingCapability.  If AS-external-LSAs are not flooded
          into/throughout the area (i.e, the area is a "stub") the E-bit
          must be clear in received Hello Packets, otherwise the E-bit
          must be set.  A mismatch causes processing to stop and the
          packet to be dropped.  The setting of the rest of the bits in
          the Hello Packet's Options field should be ignored.
