     For TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP connections to be established in the open
     state, the CER/CEA exchange MUST include an Inband-Security-ID AVP
     with a value of TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP.  The TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP
     handshake will begin when both ends successfully reach the open
     state, after completion of the CER/CEA exchange.  If the TLS/TCP and
     DTLS/SCTP handshake is successful, all further messages will be sent
     via TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP.  If the handshake fails, both ends MUST
     move to the closed state.  See Section 13.1 for more details.
