           1. Decrypts and integrity checks the ESP Payload Data, Padding,
              Pad Length, and Next Header, using the key, algorithm,
              algorithm mode, and cryptographic synchronization data (if
              any), indicated by the SA.  The SPI from the ESP header, and
              the (receiver) packet counter value (adjusted as required
              from the processing described in Section 3.4.3) are inputs
              to this algorithm, as they are required for the integrity
              check.
