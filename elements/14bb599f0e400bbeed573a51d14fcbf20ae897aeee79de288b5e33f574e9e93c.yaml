     Unlike QoS-based routing (for example, see [RFC2386], [MA], and
     [PERFORMANCE-ROUTING]) that generally addresses the issue of routing
     individual traffic flows to satisfy prescribed flow-based QoS
     requirements subject to network resource availability, constraint-
     based routing is applicable to traffic aggregates as well as flows
     and may be subject to a wide variety of constraints that may include
     policy restrictions.
