     The entities should be able to derive from the past history an
     estimate of the packet loss rate due to transmission errors.  In a
     properly configured system, this loss rate should be kept very low,
     typically less than 1%.  If a Media Gateway Controller or a Media
     Gateway has to repeat a message more than a few times, it is very
     legitimate to assume that something else than a transmission error
     is occurring.  For example, given a loss rate of 1%, the probability
     that five consecutive transmission attempts fail is 1 in 100
     billion, an event that should occur less than once every 10 days for
     a Media Gateway Controller that processes 1 000 transactions per
     second. (Indeed, the number of repetition that is considered
     excessive should be a function of the prevailing packet loss rate.)
