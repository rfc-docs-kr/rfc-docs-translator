     With reliable delivery, the incidence of loss of a transaction
     request or reply is expected to be very low.  Therefore, only simple
     timer mechanisms are required. Exponential back-off algorithms
     should not be necessary, although they could be employed where, as
     in an MGC, the code to do so is already required, since MGCs must
     implement ALF/UDP as well as TCP.
