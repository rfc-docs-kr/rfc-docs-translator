           Similarly, neighborAS(n) is a function that returns the
           neighbor AS from which the route was received.  If the route is
           learned via IBGP, and the other IBGP speaker didn't originate
           the route, it is the neighbor AS from which the other IBGP
           speaker learned the route.  If the route is learned via IBGP,
           and the other IBGP speaker either (a) originated the route, or
           (b) created the route by aggregation and the AS_PATH attribute
           of the aggregate route is either empty or begins with an
           AS_SET, it is the local AS.

  - 마찬가지로 neighborAS(n)은 경로를 수신한 Neighbor AS를 반환하는 함수입니다. 경로가 IBGP를 통해 학습되고 다른 IBGP 스피커가 경로를 시작하지 않은 경우 다른 IBGP 스피커가 경로를 학습한 것은 이웃 AS입니다. 경로가 IBGP를 통해 학습되고 다른 IBGP 스피커가 (a) 경로를 시작했거나 (b) 집계로 경로를 생성했으며 집계 경로의 AS_PATH 속성이 비어 있거나 AS_SET로 시작하는 경우 로컬 AS.
