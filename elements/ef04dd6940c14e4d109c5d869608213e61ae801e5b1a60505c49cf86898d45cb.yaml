         A tunnel is an intermediary program which is acting as a blind
         relay between two connections. Once active, a tunnel is not
         considered a party to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel
         may have been initiated by an HTTP request. The tunnel ceases to
         exist when both ends of the relayed connections are closed.
         Tunnels are used when a portal is necessary and the intermediary
         cannot, or should not, interpret the relayed communication.

  - 터널은 두 연결 사이에서 블라인드 릴레이 역할을 하는 중개 프로그램입니다. 일단 활성화되면 터널은 HTTP 요청에 의해 시작되었을 수 있지만 HTTP 통신의 당사자로 간주되지 않습니다. 릴레이된 연결의 양쪽 끝이 닫히면 터널은 더 이상 존재하지 않습니다. 터널은 포털이 필요하고 중개자가 중계된 통신을 해석할 수 없거나 해석해서는 안 되는 경우에 사용됩니다.
