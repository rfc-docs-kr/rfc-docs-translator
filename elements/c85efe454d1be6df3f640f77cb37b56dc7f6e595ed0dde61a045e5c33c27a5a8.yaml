           Path
                At a given moment, all the IP datagrams from a particular
                source host to a particular destination host will
                typically traverse the same sequence of gateways.  We use
                the term "path" for this sequence.  Note that a path is
                uni-directional; it is not unusual to have different paths
                in the two directions between a given host pair.
