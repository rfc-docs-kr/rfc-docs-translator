     The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) defined in this document
     provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the
     configuration of network devices.  It uses an Extensible Markup
     Language (XML)-based data encoding for the configuration data as well
     as the protocol messages.  The NETCONF protocol operations are
     realized as remote procedure calls (RPCs).  This document obsoletes
     RFC 4741.
