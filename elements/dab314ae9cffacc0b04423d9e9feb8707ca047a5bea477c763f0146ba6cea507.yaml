          Routing protocol packets should always be sent with the IP TOS
          field set to 0.  If at all possible, routing protocol packets
          should be given preference over regular IP data traffic, both
          when being sent and received.  As an aid to accomplishing this,
          OSPF protocol packets should have their IP precedence field set
          to the value Internetwork Control (see [Ref5]).
