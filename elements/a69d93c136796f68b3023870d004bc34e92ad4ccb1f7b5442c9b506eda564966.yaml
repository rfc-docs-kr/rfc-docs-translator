          This distillation is accomplished as follows: Each area border
          router is by definition connected to the backbone.  Each area
          border router summarizes the topology of its attached non-
          backbone areas for transmission on the backbone, and hence to
          all other area border routers.  An area border router then has
          complete topological information concerning the backbone, and
          the area summaries from each of the other area border routers.
          From this information, the router calculates paths to all
          inter-area destinations.  The router then advertises these paths
          into its attached areas.  This enables the area's internal
          routers to pick the best exit router when forwarding traffic
          inter-area destinations.
