     Aggregation is simple for an end site that is connected to one
     service provider: it uses address space assigned by its service
     provider, and that address space is a small piece of a larger block
     allocated to the service provider.  No explicit route is needed for
     the end site; the service provider advertises a single aggregate
     route for the larger block.  This advertisement provides reachability
     and routeability for all the customers numbered in the block.
