        There is a close relationship between subnetworks and routing
        domains implicit in the fact that they operate a common routing
        protocol and are under the control of a single administration. The
        routing domain administration subdivides the domain into
        subnetworks.  The routing domain represents the only path between
        a subnetwork and the rest of the internetwork. It is reasonable
        that this relationship also extend to include a common IP
        addressing space. Thus, the subnetworks within the leaf routing
        domain should take their IP addresses from the prefix assigned to
        the leaf routing domain.
