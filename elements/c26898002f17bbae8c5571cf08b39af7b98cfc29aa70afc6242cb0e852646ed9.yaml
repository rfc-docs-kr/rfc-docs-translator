     A key aspect of NETCONF is that it allows the functionality of the
     management protocol to closely mirror the native functionality of the
     device.  This reduces implementation costs and allows timely access
     to new features.  In addition, applications can access both the
     syntactic and semantic content of the device's native user interface.
