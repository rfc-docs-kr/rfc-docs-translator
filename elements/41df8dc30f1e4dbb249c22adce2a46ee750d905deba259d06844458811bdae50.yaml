     Older interior routing protocols, such as RIP [RFC1058], HELLO, and
     Cisco Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), and older exterior
     routing protocols, such as Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) [RFC904],
     do not support explicit carriage of prefix length/mask and thus
     cannot be effectively used on the Internet other than in very limited
     stub configurations.  Although their use may be appropriate in simple
     legacy end-site configurations, they are considered obsolete and
     should NOT be used in transit networks connected to the global
     Internet.
