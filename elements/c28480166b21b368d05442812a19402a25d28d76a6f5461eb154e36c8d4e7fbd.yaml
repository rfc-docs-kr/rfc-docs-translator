        It is interesting to consider whether direct service providers'
        routing domains should use their IP address space for assigning IP
        addresses from a unique prefix to the leaf routing domains that
        they serve. The benefits derived from data abstraction are greater
        than in the case of leaf routing domains, and the additional
        degree of data abstraction provided by this may be necessary in
        the short term.
