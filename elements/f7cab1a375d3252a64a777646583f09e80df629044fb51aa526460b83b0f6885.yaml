     Since JPEG frames can be large, they must often be fragmented.
     Frames SHOULD be fragmented into packets in a manner avoiding
     fragmentation at a lower level.  If support for partial frame
     decoding is desired, frames SHOULD be fragmented such that each
     packet contains an integral number of restart intervals (see below).
