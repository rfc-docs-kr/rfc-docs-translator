     There are several problems with this.  If future advances in
     cryptanalysis reveal a weakness in AES, users will be in an
     unenviable position.  With the only other widely supported cipher
     being the much slower 3DES, it is not feasible to reconfigure
     deployments to use 3DES.  [Standby-Cipher] describes this issue and
     the need for a standby cipher in greater detail.  Another problem is
     that while AES is very fast on dedicated hardware, its performance on
     platforms that lack such hardware is considerably lower.  Yet another
     problem is that many AES implementations are vulnerable to cache-
     collision timing attacks ([Cache-Collisions]).
