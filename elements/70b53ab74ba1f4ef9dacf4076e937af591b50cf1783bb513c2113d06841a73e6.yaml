          Attempt
              This state is only valid for neighbors attached to NBMA
              networks.  It indicates that no recent information has been
              received from the neighbor, but that a more concerted effort
              should be made to contact the neighbor.  This is done by
              sending the neighbor Hello packets at intervals of
              HelloInterval (see Section 9.5.1).
