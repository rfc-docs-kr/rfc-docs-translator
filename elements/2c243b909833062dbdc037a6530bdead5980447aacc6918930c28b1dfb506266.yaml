     The optional TimeStamp parameter specifies the actual time as kept by
     the sender.  It can be used by the responder to determine how its
     notion of time differs from that of its correspondent.  TimeStamp is
     sent with a precision of hundredths of a second, and is expressed in
     UTC.
