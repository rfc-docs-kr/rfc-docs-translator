           1) if the first path segment of the AS_PATH is of type
              AS_SEQUENCE, the local system prepends its own AS number as
              the last element of the sequence (put it in the leftmost
              position with respect to the position of octets in the
              protocol message).  If the act of prepending will cause an
              overflow in the AS_PATH segment (i.e., more than 255 ASes),
              it SHOULD prepend a new segment of type AS_SEQUENCE and
              prepend its own AS number to this new segment.
