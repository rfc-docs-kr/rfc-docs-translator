          An LSA is added to a router's database when either a) it is
          received during the flooding process (Section 13) or b) it is
          originated by the router itself (Section 12.4).  An LSA is
          deleted from a router's database when either a) it has been
          overwritten by a newer instance during the flooding process
          (Section 13) or b) the router originates a newer instance of one
          of its self-originated LSAs (Section 12.4) or c) the LSA ages
          out and is flushed from the routing domain (Section 14).
          Whenever an LSA is deleted from the database it must also be
          removed from all neighbors' Link state retransmission lists (see
          Section 10).
