      Hello packets are OSPF packet type 1.  These packets are sent
      periodically on all interfaces (including virtual links) in order to
      establish and maintain neighbor relationships.  In addition, Hello
      Packets are multicast on those physical networks having a multicast
      or broadcast capability, enabling dynamic discovery of neighboring
      routers.
