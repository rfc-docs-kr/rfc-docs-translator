     For Dynamic Authorization Servers implementing this specification,
     the IPsec policy would be "Require IPsec, from any to me, destination
     port UDP 3799".  This causes the Dynamic Authorization Server to
     require use of IPsec.  If some Dynamic Authorization Clients do not
     support IPsec, then a more granular policy will be required: "Require
     IPsec, from IPsec-Capable-DAC to me".
