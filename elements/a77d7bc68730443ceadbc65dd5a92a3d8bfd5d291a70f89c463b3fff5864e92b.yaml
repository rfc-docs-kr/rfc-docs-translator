     The Accounting-Request (whether for Start or Stop) is submitted to
     the RADIUS accounting server via the network. It is recommended that
     the client continue attempting to send the Accounting-Request packet
     until it receives an acknowledgement, using some form of backoff.  If
     no response is returned within a length of time, the request is re-
     sent a number of times.  The client can also forward requests to an
     alternate server or servers in the event that the primary server is
     down or unreachable.  An alternate server can be used either after a
     number of tries to the primary server fail, or in a round-robin
     fashion.  Retry and fallback algorithms are the topic of current
     research and are not specified in detail in this document.
