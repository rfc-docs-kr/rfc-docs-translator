                *  it looks for user request, i.e., it explores in
                   sequence the connection shared pages and selects the
                   one that has its 'user-net' bit turned on.  Suppose k
                   be the selected page # on the shared list, K is the
                   connection #;
                *  it determines the request type in testing the 'request
                   bits' of the shared page k.  It finds out that it is a
                   request for transmitting a message.
                *  it takes the message text from the output buffer of the
                   shared page k, formats it into a complete message and
                   transmits to the Handler in a very similar way as above
                   (See Open a primary link).
                *  it goes to sleep.
