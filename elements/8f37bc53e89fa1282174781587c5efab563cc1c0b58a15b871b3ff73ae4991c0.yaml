     Individual domains are free to choose whatever inter-domain and
     intra-domain routing architectures best meet their requirements.
     Specifically, this Applicability Statement does not prevent a domain
     or a group of domains from using addressing schemes which do not
     conform to CIDR.  Subject to the available resources in routers, CIDR
     should be able to co-exist with other addressing schemes without
     adversely impacting overall connectivity.
