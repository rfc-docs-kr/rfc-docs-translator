     The message length is the octet count of the SYSLOG-MSG in the
     SYSLOG-FRAME.  A transport receiver MUST use the message length to
     delimit a syslog message.  There is no upper limit for a message
     length per se.  However, in order to establish a baseline for
     interoperability, this specification requires that a transport
     receiver MUST be able to process messages with a length up to and
     including 2048 octets.  Transport receivers SHOULD be able to process
     messages with lengths up to and including 8192 octets.
