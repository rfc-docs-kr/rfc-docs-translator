     The <commit> operation effectively sets the running configuration to
     the current contents of the candidate configuration.  While it could
     be modeled as a simple copy, it is done as a distinct operation for a
     number of reasons.  In keeping high-level concepts as first-class
     operations, we allow developers to see more clearly both what the
     client is requesting and what the server must perform.  This keeps
     the intentions more obvious, the special cases less complex, and the
     interactions between operations more straightforward.  For example,
     the :confirmed-commit:1.1 capability (Section 8.4) would make no
     sense as a "copy confirmed" operation.
