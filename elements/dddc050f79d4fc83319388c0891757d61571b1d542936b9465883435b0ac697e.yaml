        Clients also need to understand that the level of the PROT setting
        is only checked for a particular data transfer after that transfer
        has been requested.  Thus, a refusal by the server to accept a
        particular data transfer should not be read by the client as a
        refusal to accept that data protection level completely, as not
        only may other data transfers be acceptable at that protection
        level, but it is entirely possible that the same transfer may be
        accepted at the same protection level at a later point in the
        session.
