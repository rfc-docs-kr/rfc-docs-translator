     When there is no matching Routing Key entry for an incoming SS7
     message, a default treatment MAY be specified.  Possible solutions
     are to provide a default Application Server at the SGP that directs
     all unallocated traffic to a (set of) default ASPs, or to drop the
     message and provide a notification to layer management.  The
     treatment of unallocated traffic is implementation dependent.
