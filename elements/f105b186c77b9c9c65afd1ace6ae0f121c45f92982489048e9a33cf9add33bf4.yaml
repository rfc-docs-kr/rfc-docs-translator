      Type 2 cost
          Only valid for type 2 external paths.  For these paths, this
          field indicates the cost of the path's external portion.  This
          cost has been advertised by an AS boundary router, and is the
          most significant part of the total path cost.  For example, a
          type 2 external path with type 2 cost of 5 is always preferred
          over a path with type 2 cost of 10, regardless of the cost of
          the two paths' internal components.
