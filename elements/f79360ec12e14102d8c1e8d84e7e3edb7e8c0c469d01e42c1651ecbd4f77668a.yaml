          Link State Update Packets carrying retransmissions are always
          sent directly to the neighbor. On multi-access networks, this
          means that retransmissions are sent directly to the neighbor's
          IP address.  Each LSA's LS age must be incremented by
          InfTransDelay (which must be > 0) when it is copied into the
          outgoing Link State Update packet (until the LS age field
          reaches the maximum value of MaxAge).
