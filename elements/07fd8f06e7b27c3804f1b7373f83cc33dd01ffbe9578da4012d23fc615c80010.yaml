      List of external routes
          These are routes to destinations external to the Autonomous
          System, that have been gained either through direct experience
          with another routing protocol (such as BGP), or through
          configuration information, or through a combination of the two
          (e.g., dynamic external information to be advertised by OSPF
          with configured metric). Any router having these external routes
          is called an AS boundary router.  These routes are advertised by
          the router into the OSPF routing domain via AS-external-LSAs.
