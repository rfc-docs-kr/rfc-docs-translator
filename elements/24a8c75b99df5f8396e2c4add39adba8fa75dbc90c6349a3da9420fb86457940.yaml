                   Getting no reply to its Address Mask Request messages,
                   a host will assume there is no agent and use an
                   unsubnetted mask, but the agent may be only temporarily
                   unreachable.  An agent will broadcast an unsolicited
                   Address Mask Reply whenever it initializes, in order to
                   update the masks of all hosts that have initialized in
                   the meantime.
