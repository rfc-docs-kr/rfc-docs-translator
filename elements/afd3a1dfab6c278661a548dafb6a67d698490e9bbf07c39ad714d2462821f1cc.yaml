        7. Wrath: Application is always angry with the mess it sees below
           itself. (Hey! Who is it to be pointing fingers?)
        6. Sloth: Presentation is too lazy to do anything productive by
           itself.
        5. Lust: Session is always craving and demanding what truly
           belongs to Application's functionality.
        4. Avarice: Transport wants all of the end-to-end functionality.
           (Of course, it deserves it, but life isn't fair.)
        3. Gluttony: (Connection-Oriented) Network is overweight and
           overbearing after trying too often to eat Transport's lunch.
        2. Envy: Poor Data Link is always starved for attention. (With
           Asynchronous Transfer Mode, maybe now it is feeling less
           neglected.)
        1. Pride: Physical has managed to avoid much of the controversy,
           and nearly all of the embarrassment, suffered by the others.

  1. 분노(Wrath): 애플리케이션은 항상 아래에 보이는 혼란에 분노합니다. (야! 손가락질하는 건 누구야?) 6. 나무늘보: 프레젠테이션 자체가 생산적인 일을 하기에는 너무 게으르다. 5. 욕망: 세션은 항상 응용 프로그램의 기능에 진정으로 속하는 것을 갈망하고 요구합니다. 4. 탐욕: Transport는 모든 엔드투엔드 기능을 원합니다. (물론 그럴만한 가치가 있지만 인생은 공평하지 않습니다.) 3. 폭식: (연결 지향) Transport의 점심을 너무 자주 먹으려고 시도한 후 네트워크가 과체중이고 위압적입니다. 2. 부러움: 열악한 데이터 링크는 항상 관심을 끌기 어렵습니다. (비동기 전송 모드를 사용하면 이제 덜 무시당하는 느낌이 들 수도 있습니다.) 1. 자부심: 피지컬은 다른 사람들이 겪은 많은 논란과 거의 모든 당혹감을 피했습니다.
