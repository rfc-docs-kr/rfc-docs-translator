     An Internet Fax may contain multiple e-mail addresses, both as
     originators, and as recipients.  For its forwarding function to GSTN
     fax service, an offramp gateway MUST only consider those addresses
     which are explicitly itself, i.e., those where the right-hand side of
     the e-mail address corresponds to the offramp gateway.
