        The interface between the IP layer and the transport layer MUST
        provide full access to all the mechanisms of the IP layer,
        including options, Type-of-Service, and Time-to-Live.  The
        transport layer MUST either have mechanisms to set these interface
        parameters, or provide a path to pass them through from an
        application, or both.
