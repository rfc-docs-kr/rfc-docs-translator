     When agents perform address allocations to gather TCP-based
     candidates, three types of candidates can be obtained: active
     candidates, passive candidates, and simultaneous-open (S-O)
     candidates.  An active candidate is one for which the agent will
     attempt to open an outbound connection but will not receive incoming
     connection requests.  A passive candidate is one for which the agent
     will receive incoming connection attempts but not attempt a
     connection.  An S-O candidate is one for which the agent will attempt
     to open a connection simultaneously with its peer.
