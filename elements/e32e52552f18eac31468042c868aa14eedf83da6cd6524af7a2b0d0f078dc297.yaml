              In order to minimize the chance of routing loops, all OSPF
              routers in an OSPF routing domain should have
              RFC1583Compatibility set identically. When there are routers
              present that have not been updated with the functionality
              specified in Section 16.4.1 of this memo, all routers should
              have RFC1583Compatibility set to "enabled". Otherwise, all
              routers should have RFC1583Compatibility set to "disabled",
              preventing all routing loops.
