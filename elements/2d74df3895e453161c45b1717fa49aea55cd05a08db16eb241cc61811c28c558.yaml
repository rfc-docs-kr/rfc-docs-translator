     The examples in this section use SDP for encoding of the Local and
     Remote stream descriptors. SDP is defined in RFC 2327. If there is
     any discrepancy between the SDP in the examples, and RFC 2327, the
     RFC should be consulted for correctness. Audio profiles used are
     those defined in RFC 1890, and others registered with IANA. For
     example, G.711 A-law is called PCMA in the SDP, and is assigned
     profile 0. G.723 is profile 4, and H263 is profile 34. See also
