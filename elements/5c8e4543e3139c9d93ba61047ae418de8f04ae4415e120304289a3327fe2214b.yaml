     Where EAP runs over a lower layer in which significant packet loss is
     experienced, or where the connection between the authenticator and
     authentication server experiences significant packet loss, EAP
     methods requiring many round-trips can experience difficulties.  In
     these situations, use of EAP methods with fewer roundtrips is
     advisable.
