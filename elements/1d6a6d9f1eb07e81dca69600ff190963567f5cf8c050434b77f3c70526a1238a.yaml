          The tree gives the entire path to any destination network or
          host.  However, only the next hop to the destination is used in
          the forwarding process.  Note also that the best route to any
          router has also been calculated.  For the processing of external
          data, we note the next hop and distance to any router
          advertising external routes.  The resulting routing table for
          Router RT6 is pictured in Table 2.  Note that there is a
          separate route for each end of a numbered point-to-point network
          (in this case, the serial line between Routers RT6 and RT10).
