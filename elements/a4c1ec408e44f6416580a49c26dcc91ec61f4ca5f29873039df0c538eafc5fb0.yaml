     The main difference between authenticated mode and encrypted mode is
     the portion of the test packets that are covered by HMAC and
     encrypted.  Authenticated mode permits the timestamp to be fetched
     after a portion of the packet is encrypted, but in encrypted mode all
     the sequence numbers and timestamps are fetched before encryption to
     provide maximum data-integrity protection.
