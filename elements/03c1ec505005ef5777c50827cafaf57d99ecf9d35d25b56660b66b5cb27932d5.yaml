        - Broadcast to all hosts on a remote IP network: It is
          occasionally useful to send a broadcast to all hosts on a
          non-local network; for example, to find the latest version of a
          hostname database, to bootload a host on an IP network without a
          bootserver, or to monitor the timeservers on the IP network.
          This case is the same as local-network broadcasts; the datagram
          is routed by normal mechanisms until it reaches a gateway
          attached to the destination IP network, at which point it is
          broadcast. This class of broadcasting is also known as "directed
          broadcasting", or quaintly as sending a "letter bomb" [1].
