     These networks will not be interconnected in a strictly hierarchical
     manner (for example, there is expected to be direct connectivity
     between regionals, and all of these types of networks may have direct
     international connections).  However, the total number of such TRDs
     is expected to remain (for the foreseeable future) small enough to
     allow addressing of this set of TRDs via a flat address space. These
     TRDs will be used to interconnect a wide variety of routing domains,
     each of which may comprise a single corporation, part of a
     corporation, a university campus, a government agency, or other
     organizational unit.
