     Further, it is also possible to run and evaluate CCN over popular
     testbeds [PLANETLAB] [EMULAB] [DETERLAB] [OFELIA] by directly
     running, for example, the CCNx open-source code [Salsano13]
     [Carofiglio13] [Awiphan13] [Bernardini14].  Also, the Network
     Experimentation Programming Interface (NEPI) [NEPI] is a tool
     developed for controlling and managing large-scale network
     experiments.  NEPI can be used to control and manage large-scale CCNx
     experiments, e.g., on PlanetLab [Quereilhac14].
