          The Hello Protocol is responsible for establishing and
          maintaining neighbor relationships.  It also ensures that
          communication between neighbors is bidirectional.  Hello packets
          are sent periodically out all router interfaces.  Bidirectional
          communication is indicated when the router sees itself listed in
          the neighbor's Hello Packet.  On broadcast and NBMA networks,
          the Hello Protocol elects a Designated Router for the network.
