     record_overflow
        A TLSCiphertext record was received that had a length more than
        2^14+2048 bytes, or a record decrypted to a TLSCompressed record
        with more than 2^14+1024 bytes.  This message is always fatal and
        should never be observed in communication between proper
        implementations (except when messages were corrupted in the
        network).

  Record_overflow - 길이가 2^14+2048바이트를 초과하는 TLSCiphertext 레코드가 수신되었거나 2^14+1024바이트를 초과하는 TLSCompressed 레코드로 암호 해독된 레코드가 수신되었습니다. 이 메시지는 항상 치명적이며 적절한 구현 간의 통신에서 관찰되어서는 안 됩니다(네트워크에서 메시지가 손상된 경우 제외).
