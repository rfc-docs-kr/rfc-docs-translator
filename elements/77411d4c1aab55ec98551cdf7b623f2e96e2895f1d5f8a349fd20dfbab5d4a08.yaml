     The description of the ChaCha algorithm will at various time refer to
     the ChaCha state as a "vector" or as a "matrix".  This follows the
     use of these terms in Professor Bernstein's paper.  The matrix
     notation is more visually convenient and gives a better notion as to
     why some rounds are called "column rounds" while others are called
     "diagonal rounds".  Here's a diagram of how the matrices relate to
     vectors (using the C language convention of zero being the index
     origin).
