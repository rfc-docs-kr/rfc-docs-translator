     The Timeout is interpreted differently from the definition in OWAMP
     [RFC4656].  In TWAMP, Timeout is the interval that the Session-
     Reflector MUST wait after receiving a Stop-Sessions message.  In case
     there are test packets still in transit, the Session-Reflector MUST
     reflect them if they arrive within the Timeout interval following the
     reception of the Stop-Sessions message.  The Session-Reflector MUST
     NOT reflect packets that are received beyond the timeout.
