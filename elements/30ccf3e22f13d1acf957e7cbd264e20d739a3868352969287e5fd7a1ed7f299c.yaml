          Consider the previous example, this time split into OSPF areas.
          An OSPF area configuration is pictured in Figure 6.  Router
          RT4's routing table will be described for this area
          configuration.  Router RT4 has a connection to Area 1 and a
          backbone connection.  This causes Router RT4 to view the AS as
          the concatenation of the two graphs shown in Figures 7 and 8.
          The resulting routing table is displayed in Table 13.
