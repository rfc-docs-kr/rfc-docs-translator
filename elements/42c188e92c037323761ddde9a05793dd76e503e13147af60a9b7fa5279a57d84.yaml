     The STOP method moves the recorder from the recording state back to
     the idle state.  If a RECORD request is active and the STOP request
     successfully terminates it, then the STOP response MUST contain an
     Active-Request-Id-List header field containing the RECORD request-id
     that was terminated.  In this case, no RECORD-COMPLETE event is sent

  STOP 메서드는 레코더를 레코딩 상태에서 유휴 상태로 다시 옮깁니다. RECORD 요청이 활성화되어 있고 STOP 요청이 성공적으로 종료하는 경우 STOP 응답에는 종료된 RECORD 요청 ID가 포함된 Active-Request-Id-List 헤더 필드가 포함되어야 합니다. 이 경우 RECORD-COMPLETE 이벤트가 전송되지 않습니다.
