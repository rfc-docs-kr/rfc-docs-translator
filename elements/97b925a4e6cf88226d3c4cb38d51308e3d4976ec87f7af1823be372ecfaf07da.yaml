     For sessions in which the authenticator acts as a pass-through, it
     MUST determine the outcome of the authentication solely based on the
     Accept/Reject indication sent by the backend authentication server;
     the outcome MUST NOT be determined by the contents of an EAP packet
     sent along with the Accept/Reject indication, or the absence of such
     an encapsulated EAP packet.
