     Because complete DoS protection is so difficult, security against DoS
     must be dealt with pragmatically.  In particular, some attacks which
     would be desirable to defend against cannot be defended against
     economically.  The goal should be to manage risk by defending against
     attacks with sufficiently high ratios of severity to cost of defense.
     Both severity of attack and cost of defense change as technology
     changes and therefore so does the set of attacks which should be
     defended against.

  완전한 DoS 방어는 매우 어렵기 때문에 DoS에 대한 보안은 실용적으로 처리되어야 합니다. 특히 방어가 바람직한 일부 공격은 경제적으로 방어할 수 없습니다. 목표는 심각도 대 방어 비용의 비율이 충분히 높은 공격을 방어하여 위험을 관리하는 것입니다. 기술이 변화함에 따라 공격의 심각도와 방어 비용이 모두 변하므로 방어해야 하는 일련의 공격도 마찬가지입니다.
