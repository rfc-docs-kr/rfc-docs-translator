     When a TCP connection is established for the "pop3s" service (default
     port 995), a TLS handshake begins immediately.  Clients MUST
     implement the certificate validation mechanism described in
     [RFC7817].  Once the TLS session is established, POP3 [RFC1939]
     protocol messages are exchanged as TLS application data for the
     remainder of the TCP connection.  After the server sends an +OK
     greeting, the server and client MUST enter the AUTHORIZATION state,
     even if a client certificate was supplied during the TLS handshake.
