                *  it explores the Network mail box directory and accesses
                   the file DATA;
                *  it couples the first page of this file to its virtual
                   space (Shared Zone, see 3.3.1.2).  Suppose this page to
                   be kth in the shared zone; k is the internal connection
                   #;
                *  it explores the ith slot of the new HOST table (See
                   3.3.1.1 (a)) and selects the first bit = 0, e.g., the
                   (alpha)th bit; alpha corresponds to the outgoing link
                   #;
                *  it stores information (job/process #, remote HOST #
                   (i), outgoing link # (alpha)) in the kth slot of the
                   CONNECT table (See 3.3.1.2).
                *  it momentarily stores the connection # (k) in the INPUT
                   LINK table.  This is carried out upon creating an entry
                   in this table (Hashing the key value:  "outgoing link #
                   (alpha) + remote HOST # (i) + outgoing flag".);
                *  it prepares the message text ENQ PRIM 0 0 a and formats
                   a complete message in adding leader, marking, checksum,
                   etc.;
                *  it checks the Handler state (bit in I/O locked page).
                   If the Handler is free, it stores the 'ready to go'
                   control message in the output buffer of the I/O locked
                   page, initiates the Handler, and goes to sleep.  Else
                   it goes to sleep.
