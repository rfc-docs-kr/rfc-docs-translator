     When the M3UA layer at an ASP receives a DUNA message indicating SS7
     destination unavailability at an SG, MTP Users will receive an MTP-
     PAUSE indication and will stop any affected traffic to this
     destination.  When the M3UA receives a DAVA/DRST message, MTP Users
     will receive an MTP-RESUME indication and can resume traffic to the
     newly available SS7 destination, provided that the ASP is in the
     ASP-ACTIVE state towards this SGP.
