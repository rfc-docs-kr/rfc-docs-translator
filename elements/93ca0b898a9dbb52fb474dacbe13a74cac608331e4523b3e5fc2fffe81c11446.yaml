        Note that UAs that do not understand 'multipart/related' will
        treat 'multipart/related' bodies as 'multipart/mixed' bodies.
        These UAs will not be able to process a given body as a compound
        object.  Instead, they will process the body parts according to
        their disposition type as if each body part was independent from
        each other.

  - 'multipart/related'를 이해하지 못하는 UA는 'multipart/related' 본문을 'multipart/mixed' 본문으로 취급합니다. 이러한 UA는 주어진 본문을 복합 객체로 처리할 수 없습니다. 대신 각 본문 부분이 서로 독립적인 것처럼 처분 유형에 따라 본문 부분을 처리합니다.
