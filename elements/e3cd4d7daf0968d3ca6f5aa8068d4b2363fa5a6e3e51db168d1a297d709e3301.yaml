     In most application types, the popularity distribution follows some
     power law, indicating that a small number of information items
     trigger a large proportion of the entire set of requests.  The exact
     shape of the power law popularity distribution directly impacts the
     performance of the underlying protocols.  For instance, highly skewed
     popularity distributions (e.g., a Zipf-like distribution with a high
     slope value) favor the deployment of caching schemes, since caching a
     very small set of information items can dramatically increase the
     cache hit ratio.
