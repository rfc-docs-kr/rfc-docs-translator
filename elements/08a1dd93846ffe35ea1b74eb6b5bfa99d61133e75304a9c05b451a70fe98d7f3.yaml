        - Formalised public key management.  By use of well established
          client identity mechanisms (supported by TLS) during the
          authentication phase, certificate management may be built into a
          central function.  Whilst this may not be desirable for all uses
          of secured file transfer, it offers advantages in certain
          structured environments.
