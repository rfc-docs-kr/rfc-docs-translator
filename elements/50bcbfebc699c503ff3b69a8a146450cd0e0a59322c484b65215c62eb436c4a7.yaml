      All routers connected to a common network must agree on certain
      parameters (Network mask, HelloInterval and RouterDeadInterval).
      These parameters are included in Hello packets, so that differences
      can inhibit the forming of neighbor relationships.  A detailed
      explanation of the receive processing for Hello packets is presented
      in Section 10.5.  The sending of Hello packets is covered in Section
      9.5.
