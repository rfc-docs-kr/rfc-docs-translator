     A new SignalsDescriptor replaces any existing SignalsDescriptor. Any
     signals applied to the Termination not in the replacement descriptor
     shall be stopped, and new signals are applied, except as follows.
     Signals present in the replacement descriptor and containing the
     KeepActive flagshall be continued if they are currently playing and
     have not already completed.  If a replacement signal descriptor
     contains a signal that is not currently playing and contains the
     KeepActive flag, that signal SHALL be ignored.  If the replacement
     descriptor contains a sequential signal list with the same identifier
     as the existing descriptor, then
