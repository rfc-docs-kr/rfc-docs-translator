     cached routes for the same realm and Application Id.  However, one
     has a redirect usage of ALL_SESSION, where matching requests will be
     forwarded to one peer; the other has a redirect usage of ALL_REALM,
     where request are forwarded to another peer.  Therefore, an incoming
     request that matches the realm and Application Id of both routes will
     need additional resolution.  In such a case, a routing precedence
     rule MUST be used against the redirect usage value to resolve the
     contention.  The precedence rule can be found in Section 6.13.
