     At routing domain boundaries, IP address information is exchanged
     (statically or dynamically) with other routing domains. If IP
     addresses within a routing domain are all drawn from non-contiguous
     IP address spaces (allowing no abstraction), then the boundary
     information consists of an enumerated list of all the IP addresses.
