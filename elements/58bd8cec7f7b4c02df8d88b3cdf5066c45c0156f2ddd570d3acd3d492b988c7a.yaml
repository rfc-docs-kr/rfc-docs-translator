     Diameter clients MAY have non-volatile memory for the safe storage of
     accounting records over reboots or extended network failures, network
     partitions, and server failures.  If such memory is available, the
     client SHOULD store new accounting records there as soon as the
     records are created and until a positive acknowledgement of their
     reception from the Diameter server has been received.  Upon a reboot,
     the client MUST start sending the records in the non-volatile memory
     to the accounting server with the appropriate modifications in
     termination cause, session length, and other relevant information in
     the records.
