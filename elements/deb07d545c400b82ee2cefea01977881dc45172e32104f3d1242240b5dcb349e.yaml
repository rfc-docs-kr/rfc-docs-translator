        Tutorial: Rijndael was designed to handle additional block sizes
        and key lengths that were not adopted in the AES. Rijndael was
        selected by NIST through a public competition that was held to
        find a successor to the DEA; the other finalists were MARS, RC6,
        Serpent, and Twofish.
