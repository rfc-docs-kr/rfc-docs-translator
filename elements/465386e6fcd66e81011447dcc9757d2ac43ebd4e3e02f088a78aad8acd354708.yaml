     For example, if a STOP request with no Active-Request-Id-List is sent
     to a synthesizer resource that has one or more SPEAK requests in the
     PENDING or IN-PROGRESS state, all SPEAK requests MUST be cancelled,
     including the one IN-PROGRESS.  The response to the STOP request
     contains in the Active-Request-Id-List value the request-ids of all
     the SPEAK requests that were terminated.  After sending the STOP
     response, the server MUST NOT send any SPEAK-COMPLETE or RECOGNITION-
     COMPLETE events for the terminated requests.

  예를 들어, Active-Request-Id-List가 없는 STOP 요청이 PENDING 또는 IN-PROGRESS 상태의 SPEAK 요청이 하나 이상 있는 신디사이저 리소스로 전송되는 경우, IN-PROGRESS를 포함한 모든 SPEAK 요청은 반드시 취소되어야 합니다. STOP 요청에 대한 응답에는 종료된 모든 SPEAK 요청의 요청 ID가 Active-Request-Id-List 값에 포함됩니다. STOP 응답을 보낸 후, 서버는 종료된 요청에 대해 SPEAK-COMPLETE 또는 RECOGNITION-COMPLETE 이벤트를 보내서는 안 됩니다.
