        Unassigned:  Not currently assigned, and available for assignment
              via documented procedures.  While it's generally clear that
              any values that are not registered are unassigned and
              available for assignment, it is sometimes useful to
              explicitly specify that situation.  Note that this is
              distinctly different from "Reserved".
