     The receiver of an answer message with the 'E' bit set and the
     Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_REDIRECT_INDICATION uses the Hop-by-
     Hop Identifier in the Diameter header to identify the request in the
     pending message queue (see Section 5.5.4) that is to be redirected.
     If no transport connection exists with the new peer, one is created,
     and the request is sent directly to it.
