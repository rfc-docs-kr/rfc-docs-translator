     defines a new SMTP "tls" Received header additional-registered-clause
     that is used to record the TLS ciphersuite that was negotiated for
     the connection.  This clause SHOULD be included whenever a Submission
     server generates a Received header field for a message received via
     TLS.  The value included in this additional clause SHOULD be the
     registered ciphersuite name (e.g.,
     TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256) included in the "TLS Cipher
     Suite Registry".  In the event that the implementation does not know
     the name of the ciphersuite (a situation that should be remedied
     promptly), a four-digit hexadecimal ciphersuite identifier MAY be
     used.  In addition, the Diffie-Hellman group name associated with the
     ciphersuite MAY be included (when applicable and known) following the
     ciphersuite name.  The ABNF for the field follows:
