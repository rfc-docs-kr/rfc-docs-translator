        Allocation of IP addresses based on connectivity to TRDs is
        important to allow scaling of inter-domain routing to an internet
        containing millions of routing domains. However, such address
        allocation based on topology implies that in order to maximize the
        efficiency in routing gained by such allocation, certain changes
        in topology may suggest a change of address.
