             single subtree that includes all names of that name type or
             one or more subtrees that each specifies a subset of the
             names of that name type, or the set may be empty.  If the set
             for a name type is empty, then the certification path will be
             considered invalid if any certificate in the certification
             path includes a name of that name type.
