          Several of the OSPF packet types list LSAs.  When the instance
          is not important, an LSA is referred to by its LS type, Link
          State ID and Advertising Router (see Link State Request
          Packets).  Otherwise, the LS sequence number, LS age and LS
          checksum fields must also be referenced.
