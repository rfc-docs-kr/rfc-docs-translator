     The IPv4 routing system architecture carries topology information
     based on aggregate address advertisements and a collection of more-
     specific advertisements that are associated with traffic engineering,
     multi-homing, and local configuration.  As of March 2005, the base
     aggregate address load in the routing system has some 75,000 entries.
