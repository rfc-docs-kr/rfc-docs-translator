        The Expanded Nak Type is valid only in Response messages.  It MUST
        be sent only in reply to a Request of Type 254 (Expanded Type)
        where the authentication Type is unacceptable.  The Expanded Nak
        Type uses the Expanded Type format itself, and the Response
        contains one or more authentication Types desired by the peer, all
        in Expanded Type format.  Type zero (0) is used to indicate that
        the sender has no viable alternatives.  The general format of the
        Expanded Type is described in Section 5.7.
