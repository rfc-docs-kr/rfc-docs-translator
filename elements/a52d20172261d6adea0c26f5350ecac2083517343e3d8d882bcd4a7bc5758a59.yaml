           o  For implementations that do not follow RFC 5961, the
              original behavior described in RFC 793 follows in this
              paragraph.  If the SYN is in the window it is an error: send
              a reset, any outstanding RECEIVEs and SEND should receive
              "reset" responses, all segment queues should be flushed, the
              user should also receive an unsolicited general "connection
              reset" signal, enter the CLOSED state, delete the TCB, and
              return.
