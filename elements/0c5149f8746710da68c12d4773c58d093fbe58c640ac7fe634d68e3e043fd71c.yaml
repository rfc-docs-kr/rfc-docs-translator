              The sequence number field is a signed 32-bit integer.  It is
              used to detect old and duplicate LSAs.  The space of
              sequence numbers is linearly ordered.  The larger the
              sequence number (when compared as signed 32-bit integers)
              the more recent the LSA.  To describe to sequence number
              space more precisely, let N refer in the discussion below to
              the constant 2**31.
