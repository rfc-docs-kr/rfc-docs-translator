          (b) Otherwise immediately flood the new LSA out some subset of
              the router's interfaces (see Section 13.3).  In some cases
              (e.g., the state of the receiving interface is DR and the
              LSA was received from a router other than the Backup DR) the
              LSA will be flooded back out the receiving interface.  This
              occurrence should be noted for later use by the
              acknowledgment process (Section 13.5).
