     Poly1305 is not a suitable choice for a PRF.  Poly1305 prohibits
     using the same key twice, whereas the PRF in IKEv2 is used multiple
     times with the same key.  Additionally, unlike HMAC, Poly1305 is
     biased, so using it for key derivation would reduce the security of
     the symmetric encryption.
