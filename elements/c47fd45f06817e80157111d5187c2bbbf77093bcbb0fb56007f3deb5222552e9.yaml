     The SGP provides a functional interworking of transport functions
     between the SS7 network and the IP network by also supporting the
     M3UA adaptation layer.  It allows the transfer of MTP3-User
     signalling messages to and from an IP-based Application Server
     Process where the peer MTP3-User protocol layer exists.
