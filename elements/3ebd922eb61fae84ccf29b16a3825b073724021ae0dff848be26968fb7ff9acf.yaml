     The IETF has been working for more than a decade on devising metrics
     and methods for measuring the performance of IP networks.  The work
     has been carried out largely within the IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
     working group, guided by a relevant framework [RFC2330].  IPPM
     metrics include delay, delay variation, loss, reordering, and
     duplication.  While the IPPM work is certainly based on packet-
     switched IP networks, it is conceivable that it can be modified and
     extended to cover ICN networks as well.  However, more study is
     necessary to turn this claim into a certainty.  Many experts have
     toiled for a long time on devising and refining the IPPM metrics and
     methods, so it would be an advantage to use them for measuring ICN
     performance.  In addition, said metrics and methods work already for
     host-centric networks, so comparison with information-centric
     networks would entail only the ICN extension of the IPPM framework.
     Finally, an important benefit of measuring the transport performance
     of a network at its output, using Quality of Service (QoS) metrics
     such as IPPM, is that it can be done mostly without any dependence to
     applications.
