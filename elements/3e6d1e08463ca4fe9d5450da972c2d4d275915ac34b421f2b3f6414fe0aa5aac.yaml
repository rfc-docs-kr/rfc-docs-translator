     Within EAP, the Code field functions much like a protocol number in
     IP.  It is assumed that the EAP layer demultiplexes incoming EAP
     packets according to the Code field.  Received EAP packets with
     Code=1 (Request), 3 (Success), and 4 (Failure) are delivered by the
     EAP layer to the EAP peer layer, if implemented.  EAP packets with
     Code=2 (Response) are delivered to the EAP authenticator layer, if
     implemented.
