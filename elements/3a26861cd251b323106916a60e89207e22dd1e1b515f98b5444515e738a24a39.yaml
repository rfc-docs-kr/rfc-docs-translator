     As shown in Figure 1, an ASP may be connected to multiple SGPs.  In
     such a case, a particular SS7 destination may be reachable via more
     than one SGP and/or SG; i.e., via more than one route.  As MTP3 users
     only maintain status on a destination and not on a route basis, the
     M3UA layer must maintain the status (availability, restriction,
     and/or congestion of route to destination) of the individual routes,
     derive the overall availability or congestion status of the
     destination from the status of the individual routes, and inform the
     MTP3 users of this derived status whenever it changes.
