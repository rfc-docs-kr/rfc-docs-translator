      o   Just as the virtual link's cost and viability are determined by
          the routing table build process (through construction of the
          routing table entry for the other endpoint), so are the IP
          interface address for the virtual interface and the virtual
          neighbor's IP address.  These are used when sending OSPF
          protocol packets over the virtual link. Note that when one (or
          both) of the virtual link endpoints connect to the Transit area
          via an unnumbered point-to-point link, it may be impossible to
          calculate either the virtual interface's IP address and/or the
          virtual neighbor's IP address, thereby causing the virtual link
          to fail.
