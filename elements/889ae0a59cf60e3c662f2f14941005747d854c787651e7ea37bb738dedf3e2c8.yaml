      DESCRIPTION
         "The relative order in which classifier elements are applied:
         higher numbers represent classifier element with higher
         precedence.  Classifier elements with the same order must be
         unambiguous i.e. they must define non-overlapping patterns, and
         are considered to be applied simultaneously to the traffic
         stream. Classifier elements with different order may overlap in
         their filters:  the classifier element with the highest order
         that matches is taken.
