     All non-Transfer and non-SSNM messages, except BEAT and BEAT Ack,
     SHOULD be sent with sequenced delivery to ensure ordering.  ASPTM
     messages MAY be sent on one of the streams used to carry the data
     traffic related to the Routing Context(s), to minimize possible
     message loss.  BEAT and BEAT Ack messages MAY be sent using out-of-
     order delivery and MAY be sent on any stream.
