          SeqNumberMismatch
              A Database Description packet has been received that either
              a) has an unexpected DD sequence number, b) unexpectedly has
              the Init bit set or c) has an Options field differing from
              the last Options field received in a Database Description
              packet.  Any of these conditions indicate that some error
              has occurred during adjacency establishment.
