     Note: As was stated earlier, there are other standards documents,
     specifically the MIME documents [RFC2045, RFC2046, RFC2048, RFC2049]
     that extend this standard to allow for different sorts of message
     bodies.  Again, these mechanisms are beyond the scope of this
     document.

  참고: 앞서 설명한 대로 다른 표준 문서, 특히 다양한 종류의 메시지 본문을 허용하도록 이 표준을 확장하는 MIME 문서[RFC2045, RFC2046, RFC2048, RFC2049]가 있습니다.  다시 말하지만 이러한 메커니즘은 이 문서의 범위를 벗어납니다.
