     However, it is possible that the EAP peer's access policy was not
     satisfied during the initial EAP exchange, even though mutual
     authentication occurred.  For example, the EAP authenticator may not
     have demonstrated authorization to act in both peer and authenticator
     roles.  As a result, the peer may require an additional
     authentication in the reverse direction, even if the peer provided an
     indication that the EAP server had successfully authenticated to it.
