     A better solution would be to have the front-end of the remote program
     -- that is the part scanning for <- and <CR> -- be resident in our
     computer.  In that case, only one five character message would be
     sent, i.e., H E L P <CR>, and the screen would be managed locally.

  더 나은 해결책은 원격 프로그램의 프런트엔드(<- 및 <CR>을 검색하는 부분)를 컴퓨터에 두는 것입니다. 이 경우 H E L P <CR>과 같은 5자 메시지 하나만 전송되고 화면은 로컬에서 관리됩니다.
