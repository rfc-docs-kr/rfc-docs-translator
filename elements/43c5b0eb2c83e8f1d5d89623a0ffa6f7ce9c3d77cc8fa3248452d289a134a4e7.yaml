              The recommended upper and lower bounds on the RTO are known
              to be inadequate on large internets.  The lower bound SHOULD
              be measured in fractions of a second (to accommodate high
              speed LANs) and the upper bound should be 2*MSL, i.e., 240
              seconds.
