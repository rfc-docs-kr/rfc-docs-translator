     Signalling Gateway (SG) - An SG is a signaling agent that
     receives/sends SCN native signaling at the edge of the IP network
     [12].  An SG appears to the SS7 network as an SS7 Signalling Point.
     An SG contains a set of one or more unique Signalling Gateway
     Processes, of which one or more is normally actively processing
     traffic.  Where an SG contains more than one SGP, the SG is a logical
     entity, and the contained SGPs are assumed to be coordinated into a
     single management view to the SS7 network and to the supported
     Application Servers.
