        While server-initiated messages are defined in RADIUS [RFC5176],
        support is optional.  This makes it difficult to implement
        features such as unsolicited disconnect or re-authentication/
        re-authorization on demand across a heterogeneous deployment.  To
        address this issue, support for server-initiated messages is
        mandatory in Diameter.
