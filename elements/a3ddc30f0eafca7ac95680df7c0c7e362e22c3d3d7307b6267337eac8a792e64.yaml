     3. Now that the AES process is completed there will be commercial
        pressure to use the selected cipher.  The AES is efficient and has
        withstood extensive cryptanalytic efforts.  The AES is therefore a
        desirable choice.

  1. 이제 AES 프로세스가 완료되었으므로 선택한 암호를 사용하라는 상업적 압력이 있을 것입니다. AES는 효율적이며 광범위한 암호화 분석 노력을 견뎌냈습니다. 따라서 AES는 바람직한 선택입니다.
