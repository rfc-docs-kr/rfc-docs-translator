     [3] The authenticator sends an additional Request packet, and the
         peer replies with a Response.  The sequence of Requests and
         Responses continues as long as needed.  EAP is a 'lock step'
         protocol, so that other than the initial Request, a new Request
         cannot be sent prior to receiving a valid Response.  The
         authenticator is responsible for retransmitting requests as
         described in Section 4.1.  After a suitable number of
         retransmissions, the authenticator SHOULD end the EAP
         conversation.  The authenticator MUST NOT send a Success or
         Failure packet when retransmitting or when it fails to get a
         response from the peer.
