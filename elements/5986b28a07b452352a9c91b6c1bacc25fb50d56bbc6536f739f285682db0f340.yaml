          IP supernetting support
              The router's IP protocol support must include the ability to
              aggregate contiguous collections of IP class A, B, and C
              networks into larger quantities called supernets.
              Supernetting has been proposed as one way to improve the
              scaling of IP routing in the worldwide Internet. For more
              information on IP supernetting, see [Ref10].
