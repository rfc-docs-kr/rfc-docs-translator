     The M3UA layer may also be used for point-to-point signalling between
     two IP Server Processes (IPSPs).  In this case, the M3UA layer
     provides the same set of primitives and services at its upper layer
     as the MTP3.  However, in this case the expected MTP3 services are
     not offered remotely from an SGP.  The MTP3 services are provided,
     but the procedures to support these services are a subset of the MTP3
     procedures, due to the simplified point-to-point nature of the IPSP-
     to-IPSP relationship.
