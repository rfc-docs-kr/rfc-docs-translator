     In order to be able to compare different ICN approaches, it would be
     beneficial to be able to define equivalence in terms of different
     resources that today are considered incomparable.  For example, would
     provisioning an additional 5 Mbit/s link capacity lead to better
     performance than adding 100 GB of in-network storage?  Within this
     context, one would consider resource equivalence (and the associated
     trade-offs) -- for example, for cache hit ratios per GB of cache,
     forwarding decision times, CPU cycles per forwarding decision, and so
     on.
