     One of the advantages of the EAP architecture is its flexibility.
     EAP is used to select a specific authentication mechanism, typically
     after the authenticator requests more information in order to
     determine the specific authentication method to be used.  Rather than
     requiring the authenticator to be updated to support each new
     authentication method, EAP permits the use of a backend
     authentication server, which may implement some or all authentication
     methods, with the authenticator acting as a pass-through for some or
     all methods and peers.
