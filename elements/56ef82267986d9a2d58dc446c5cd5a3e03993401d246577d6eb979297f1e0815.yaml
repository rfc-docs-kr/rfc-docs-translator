     Before forwarding or routing a request, Diameter agents, in addition
     to performing the processing described in Section 6.1.3, SHOULD check
     for the presence of a candidate route's peer identity in any of the
     Route-Record AVPs.  In the event of the agent detecting the presence
     of a candidate route's peer identity in a Route-Record AVP, the agent
     MUST ignore such a route for the Diameter request message and attempt
     alternate routes if any exist.  In case all the candidate routes are
     eliminated by the above criteria, the agent SHOULD return a
     DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER message.
