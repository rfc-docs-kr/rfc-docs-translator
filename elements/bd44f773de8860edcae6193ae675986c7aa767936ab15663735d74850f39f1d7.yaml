     If an application uses accounting messages, it can correlate
     accounting records with a specific application session by using the
     Session-Id of the particular application session in the accounting
     messages.  Accounting messages MAY also use a different Session-Id
     from that of the application sessions, in which case, other session-
     related information is needed to perform correlation.
