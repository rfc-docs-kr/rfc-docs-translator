          (7) If the above calculations have caused the identity of either
              the Designated Router or Backup Designated Router to change,
              the set of adjacencies associated with this interface will
              need to be modified.  Some adjacencies may need to be
              formed, and others may need to be broken.  To accomplish
              this, invoke the event AdjOK?  on all neighbors whose state
              is at least 2-Way.  This will cause their eligibility for
              adjacency to be reexamined (see Sections 10.3 and 10.4).
