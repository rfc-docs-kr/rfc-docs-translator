     There are multiple ways to connect an AVAS service (e.g., "Antivirus
     & Antispam") to a mail server.  Some mechanisms, such as the de facto
     "milter" protocol, are out of scope for this specification.  However,
     some services use an SMTP relay proxy that intercepts mail at the
     application layer to perform a scan and proxy or forward to another
     Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).  Deploying AVAS services in this way can
     cause many problems [RFC2979], including direct interference with
     this specification, and other forms of confidentiality or security
     reduction.  An AVAS product or service is considered compatible with
     this specification if all IMAP, POP, and SMTP-related software
     (including proxies) it includes are compliant with this
     specification.
