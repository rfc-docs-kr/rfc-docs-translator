           The Internet includes a great variety of host and gateway
           systems, each implementing many protocols and protocol layers,
           and some of these contain bugs and mis-features in their
           Internet protocol software.  As a result of complexity,
           diversity, and distribution of function, the diagnosis of
           Internet problems is often very difficult.
