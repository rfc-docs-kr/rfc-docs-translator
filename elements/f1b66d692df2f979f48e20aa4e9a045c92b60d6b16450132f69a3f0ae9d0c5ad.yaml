          (4) Else, call the destination described by the LSA N (for Type
              3 summary-LSAs, N's address is obtained by masking the LSA's
              Link State ID with the network/subnet mask contained in the
              body of the LSA), and the area border originating the LSA
              BR.  Look up the routing table entry for BR having Area A as
              its associated area.  If no such entry exists for router BR
              (i.e., BR is unreachable in Area A), do nothing with this
              LSA and consider the next in the list.  Else, this LSA
              describes an inter-area path to destination N, whose cost is
              the distance to BR plus the cost specified in the LSA. Call
              the cost of this inter-area path IAC.
