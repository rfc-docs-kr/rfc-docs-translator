     Commands between the Media Gateway Controller and the Media Gateway
     are grouped into Transactions, each of which is identified by a
     TransactionID.  Transactions consist of one or more Actions.  An
     Action consists of a series of Commands that are limited to operating
     within a single Context.   Consequently each Action typically
     specifies a ContextID.  However, there are two circumstances where a
     specific ContextID is not provided with an Action.  One is the case
     of modification of a Termination outside of a Context.  The other is
     where the controller requests the gateway to create a new Context.
     Following is a graphic representation of the Transaction, Action and
     Command relationships.
