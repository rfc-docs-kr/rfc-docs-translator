     A variety of methods are used in practice to test URI equivalence.
     These methods fall into a range, distinguished by the amount of
     processing required and the degree to which the probability of false
     negatives is reduced.  As noted above, false negatives cannot be
     eliminated.  In practice, their probability can be reduced, but this
     reduction requires more processing and is not cost-effective for all
     applications.

  실제로 URI 동등성을 테스트하기 위해 다양한 방법이 사용됩니다. 이러한 방법은 필요한 처리량과 위음성 가능성이 감소되는 정도에 따라 구분되는 범위에 속합니다. 위에서 언급했듯이 거짓음성은 제거될 수 없습니다. 실제로는 확률을 줄일 수 있지만 이렇게 줄이려면 더 많은 처리가 필요하며 모든 애플리케이션에 비용 효율적이지는 않습니다.
