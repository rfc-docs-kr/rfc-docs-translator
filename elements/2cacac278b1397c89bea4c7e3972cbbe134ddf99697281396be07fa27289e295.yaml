     Both the Server and the Client use the same mappings from KeyIDs to
     shared secrets.  The Server, being prepared to conduct sessions with
     more than one Client, uses KeyIDs to choose the appropriate secret
     key; a Client would typically have different secret keys for
     different Servers.  The shared secret is a passphrase.  To maximize
     passphrase interoperability, the passphrase character set MUST be
     encoded using Appendix B of [RFC5198] (the ASCII Network Virtual
     Terminal Definition).  It MUST not contain newlines (any combination
     of Carriage-Return (CR) and/or Line-Feed (LF) characters), and
     control characters SHOULD be avoided.
