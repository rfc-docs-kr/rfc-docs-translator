              Defining sip:user@host to not be equivalent to
              sip:user@host:5060 is a change from RFC 2543.  When deriving
              addresses from URIs, equivalent addresses are expected from
              equivalent URIs.  The URI sip:user@host:5060 will always
              resolve to port 5060.  The URI sip:user@host may resolve to
              other ports through the DNS SRV mechanisms detailed in [4].
