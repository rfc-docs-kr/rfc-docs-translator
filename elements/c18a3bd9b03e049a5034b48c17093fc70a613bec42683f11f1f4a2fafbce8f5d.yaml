            This MUST NOT be an absolute time.  This MUST NOT be an
            absolute number of seconds since Jan. 1, 1970.  Instead, this
            MUST be an integer number of seconds in the past from the time
            the DHCPLEASEACTIVE message is sent that the client last dealt
            with this server about this IP address.  In the same way that
            the IP Address Lease Time option (option 51) encodes a lease
            time that is a number of seconds into the future from the time
            the message was sent, this option encodes a value that is a
            number of seconds into the past from when the message was
            sent.
