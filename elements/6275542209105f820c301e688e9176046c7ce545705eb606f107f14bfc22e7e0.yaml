        This fourth solution is likely to be important when use of public
        data networks becomes more common. In particular, it is likely
        that at some point in the future a substantial percentage of all
        routing domains will be attached to public data networks. In this
        case, nearly all government-sponsored networks (such as some
        current regionals) may have a set of customers which overlaps
        substantially with the public networks.
