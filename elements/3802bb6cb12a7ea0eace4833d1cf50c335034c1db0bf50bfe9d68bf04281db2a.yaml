      o   In RFC 2035, the encoding of restart marker information in the
          Type field made it difficult to add new types. Additionally, the
          type- specific field was used for the restart count, making it
          unavailable for other type-specific purposes.  This memo moves
          the restart marker indication to a particular bit in the Type
          field, and adds an optional header to hold the additional
          information required, leaving the type-specific field free for
          its intended purpose.  The handling of partial frame decoding
          was also made more robust against packet loss.  See sections
          3.1.7 and 4.4 for details.
