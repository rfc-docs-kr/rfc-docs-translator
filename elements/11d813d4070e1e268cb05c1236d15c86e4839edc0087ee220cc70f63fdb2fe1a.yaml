      DESCRIPTION
         "The maximum rate in kilobits/sec that a downstream scheduler
         element should allocate to this queue. If the value is zero, then
         there is effectively no maximum rate limit and that the scheduler
         should attempt to be work conserving for this queue. If the value
         is non-zero, the scheduler will limit the servicing of this queue
         to, at most, this rate in a non-work-conserving manner.
