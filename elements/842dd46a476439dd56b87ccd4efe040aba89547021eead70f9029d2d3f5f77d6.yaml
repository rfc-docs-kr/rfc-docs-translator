        (a)  When the subject of the certificate is a CA, the subject
             field MUST be encoded in the same way as it is encoded in the
             issuer field (Section 4.1.2.4) in all certificates issued by
             the subject CA.  Thus, if the subject CA encodes attributes
             in the issuer fields of certificates that it issues using the
             TeletexString, BMPString, or UniversalString encodings, then
             the subject field of certificates issued to that CA MUST use
             the same encoding.
