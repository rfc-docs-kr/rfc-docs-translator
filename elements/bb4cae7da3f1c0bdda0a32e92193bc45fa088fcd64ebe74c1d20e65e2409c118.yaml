        This field MAY contain a displayable message in the Request,
        containing UTF-8 encoded ISO 10646 characters [RFC2279].  Where
        the Request contains a null, only the portion of the field prior
        to the null is displayed.  If the Identity is unknown, the
        Identity Response field should be zero bytes in length.  The
        Identity Response field MUST NOT be null terminated.  In all
        cases, the length of the Type-Data field is derived from the
        Length field of the Request/Response packet.
