     The HTTP protocol has evolved considerably over the past four years.
     It has benefited from a large and active developer community--the
     many people who have participated on the www-talk mailing list--and
     it is that community which has been most responsible for the success
     of HTTP and of the World-Wide Web in general. Marc Andreessen, Robert
     Cailliau, Daniel W. Connolly, Bob Denny, Jean-Francois Groff, Phillip
     M. Hallam-Baker, Hakon W. Lie, Ari Luotonen, Rob McCool, Lou
     Montulli, Dave Raggett, Tony Sanders, and Marc VanHeyningen deserve
     special recognition for their efforts in defining aspects of the
     protocol for early versions of this specification.
