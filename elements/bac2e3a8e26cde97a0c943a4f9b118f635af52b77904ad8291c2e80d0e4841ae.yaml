     If no Heartbeat Ack message (or any other M3UA message) is received
     from the M3UA peer within 2*T(beat), the remote M3UA peer is
     considered unavailable.  Transmission of Heartbeat messages is
     stopped, and the signalling process SHOULD attempt to re-establish
     communication if it is configured as the client for the disconnected
     M3UA peer.
