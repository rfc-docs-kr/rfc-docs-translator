     Thank you to Damian Poddebniak, Fabian Ising, Hanno Boeck, and
     Sebastian Schinzel for pointing out that the ENABLE command should be
     a member of "command-auth" and not "command-any" ABNF production, as
     well as pointing out security issues associated with ALERT, PREAUTH,
     and other responses received before authentication.

  ENABLE 명령이 "모든 명령" ABNF 프로덕션이 아니라 "command-auth"의 구성원이어야 함을 지적하고 관련된 보안 문제를 지적한 Damian Poddebniak, Fabian Ising, Hanno Boeck 및 Sebastian Schinzel에게 감사드립니다. 인증 전에 받은 ALERT, PREAUTH 및 기타 응답을 사용합니다.
