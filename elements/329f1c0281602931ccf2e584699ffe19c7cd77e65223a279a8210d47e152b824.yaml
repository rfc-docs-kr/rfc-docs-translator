     The nonce cryptographically binds a request and a response to prevent
     replay attacks.  The nonce is included as one of the
     requestExtensions in requests, while in responses it would be
     included as one of the responseExtensions.  In both the request and
     the response, the nonce will be identified by the object identifier
     id-pkix-ocsp-nonce, while the extnValue is the value of the nonce.

  Nonce는 요청과 응답을 암호화 방식으로 바인딩하여 재생 공격을 방지합니다. Nonce는 요청의 requestExtension 중 하나로 포함되는 반면, 응답에서는 responseExtension 중 하나로 포함됩니다. 요청과 응답 모두에서 nonce는 객체 식별자 id-pkix-ocsp-nonce로 식별되는 반면 extnValue는 nonce의 값입니다.
