     Many heuristic approaches are used to terminate sessions. You can
     make the assumption that TCP sessions that have not been used for
     say, 24 hours, and non-TCP sessions that have not been used for a
     couple of minutes, are terminated. Often this assumption works, but
     sometimes it doesn't. These idle period session timeouts vary a great
     deal both from application to application and for different sessions
     of the same application. Consequently, session timeouts must be
     configurable. Even so, there is no guarantee that a satisfactory
     value can be found. Further, as stated in section 2.3, there is no
     guarantee that NAT's view of session termination will coincide with
     that of the application.
