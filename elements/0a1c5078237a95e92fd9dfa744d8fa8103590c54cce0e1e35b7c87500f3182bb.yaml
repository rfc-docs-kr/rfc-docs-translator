     Generally, if a manager attempts to create a row, the agent will
     create the row and return success.  If the agent has insufficient
     resources or such a row already exists, then it returns an error.  A
     manager must be prepared to try again in such circumstances, probably
     by re-reading the NextFree to obtain a new index value in case a
     second manager had got in between the first manager's read of the
     NextFree value and the first manager's row-creation attempt.
