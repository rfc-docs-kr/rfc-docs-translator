     Traffic metrics in existing ICN approaches are summarized in Table 4.
     These are metrics for evaluating an approach mainly from the
     perspective of the end user, i.e., the consumer, provider, or owner
     of the content or service.  Depending on the level where these
     metrics are measured, we have made the distinction into user,
     application, and network-level traffic metrics.  So, for example,
     network-level metrics are mostly focused on packet characteristics,
     whereas user-level metrics can cover elements of human perception.
     The approaches do not make this distinction explicitly, but we can
     see from the table that CCN and NetInf have used metrics from all
     levels, PURSUIT and COMET have focused on lower-level metrics, and
     Connect and CONVERGENCE opted for higher-level metrics.  Throughput
     and download time seem to be the most popular metrics altogether.
