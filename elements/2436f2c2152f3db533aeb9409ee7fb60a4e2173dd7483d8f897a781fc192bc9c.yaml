        1 : Image is an odd field of an interlaced video signal.  The
            height specified in the main JPEG header is half of the height
            of the entire displayed image.  This field should be de-
            interlaced with the even field following it such that lines
            from each of the images alternate.  Corresponding lines from
            the even field should appear just above those same lines from
            the odd field.
