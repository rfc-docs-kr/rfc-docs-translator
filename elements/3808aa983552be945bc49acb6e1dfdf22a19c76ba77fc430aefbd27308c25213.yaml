        For example, suppose that a very large North American company
        "Mega Big International Incorporated" (MBII) has a fully
        interconnected internal network and is assigned a single prefix as
        part of the North American prefix.  It is likely that outside of
        North America, a single entry may be maintained in routing tables
        for all North American destinations.  However, within North
        America, every provider will need to maintain a separate address
        entry for MBII. If MBII is in fact an international corporation,
        then it may be necessary for every provider worldwide to maintain
        a separate entry for MBII (including backbones to which MBII is
        not attached). Clearly this may be acceptable if there are a small
        number of such multi-homed routing domains, but would place an
        unacceptable load on routers within backbones if all organizations
        were to choose such address assignments.  This solution may not
        scale to internets where there are many hundreds of thousands of
        multi-homed organizations.
