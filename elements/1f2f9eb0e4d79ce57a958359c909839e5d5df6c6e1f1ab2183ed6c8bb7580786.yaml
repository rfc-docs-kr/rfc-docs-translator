        - Single-destination datagram broadcast on the local IP net: A
          datagrams is destined for a specific IP host, but the sending
          host broadcasts it at the data link layer, perhaps to avoid
          having to do routing.  Since this is not an IP broadcast, the IP
          layer is not involved, except that a host should discard
          datagrams not meant for it without becoming flustered (i.e.,
          printing an error message).
