     Twice-NAT works as follows. When Host-A wishes to initiate a session
     to Host-X, it issues a DNS query for Host-X. A DNS-ALG intercepts the
     DNS query, and in the response returned to Host-A the DNS-ALG
     replaces the address for Host-X with one that is properly routable in
     the local site (say Host-XPRIME). Host A then initiates communication
     with Host-XPRIME. When the packets traverse the NAT device, the
     source IP address is translated (as in the case of traditional NAT)
     and the destination address is translated to Host-X. A similar
     translation is performed on return packets coming from Host-X.
