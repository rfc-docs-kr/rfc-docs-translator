        DHE_RSA            RSA public key; the certificate MUST allow the
        ECDHE_RSA          key to be used for signing (the
                           digitalSignature bit MUST be set if the key
                           usage extension is present) with the signature
                           scheme and hash algorithm that will be employed
                           in the server key exchange message.
                           Note: ECDHE_RSA is defined in [TLSECC].
