     If the SMTP client decides that the level of authentication or
     privacy is not high enough for it to continue, it SHOULD issue an
     SMTP QUIT command immediately after the TLS negotiation is complete.
     If the SMTP server decides that the level of authentication or
     privacy is not high enough for it to continue, it SHOULD reply to
     every SMTP command from the client (other than a QUIT command) with
     the 554 reply code (with a possible text string such as "Command
     refused due to lack of security").
