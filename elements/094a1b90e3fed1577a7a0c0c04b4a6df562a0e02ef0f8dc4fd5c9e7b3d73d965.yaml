          A router may only prematurely age its own self-originated LSAs.
          The router may not prematurely age LSAs that have been
          originated by other routers. An LSA is considered self-
          originated when either 1) the LSA's Advertising Router is equal
          to the router's own Router ID or 2) the LSA is a network-LSA and
          its Link State ID is equal to one of the router's own IP
          interface addresses.
