     An SG may be logically partitioned to operate in multiple SS7 network
     appearances.  In such a case, the SG could be addressable with a
     Point Code in each network appearance, and it represents a set of
     nodes in the IP domain into each SS7 network.  Alias Point Codes [8]
     may also be used within an SG network appearance.
