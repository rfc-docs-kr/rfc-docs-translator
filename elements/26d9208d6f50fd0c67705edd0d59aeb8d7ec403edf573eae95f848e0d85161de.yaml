     To follow rule #1, PA will need to advertise the block of addresses
     that it was given and C7.  Since C4 is multi-homed and primary
     through PA, it must also be advertised.  C5 is multi-homed and
     primary through PB.  In principle (and in the example above), it need
     not be advertised, since longest match by PB will automatically
     select PB as primary and the advertisement of PA's aggregate will be
     used as a secondary.  In actual practice, C5 will normally be
     advertised via both providers.
