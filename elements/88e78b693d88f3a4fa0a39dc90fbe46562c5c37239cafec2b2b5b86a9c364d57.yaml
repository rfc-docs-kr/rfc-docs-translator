      All LSAs begin with a common 20 byte header.  This header contains
      enough information to uniquely identify the LSA (LS type, Link State
      ID, and Advertising Router).  Multiple instances of the LSA may
      exist in the routing domain at the same time.  It is then necessary
      to determine which instance is more recent.  This is accomplished by
      examining the LS age, LS sequence number and LS checksum fields that
      are also contained in the LSA header.
