     Protocol messages as defined in this document may be transmitted
     over TCP.  When no port is specified by the other side (see section
     7.2.8), the commands should be sent to the default port. The defined
     protocol has messages as the unit of transfer, while TCP is a
     stream-oriented protocol.  TPKT, according to RFC1006 SHALL be used
     to delineate messages within the TCP stream.
