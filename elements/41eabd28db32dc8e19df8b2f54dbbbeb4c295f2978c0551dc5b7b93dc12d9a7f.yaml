        Tutorial: This approach has long been discredited in cryptography,
        where the phrase refers to trying to keep an algorithm secret,
        rather than just concealing the keys [Schn]. One must assume that
        mass-produced or widely fielded cryptographic devices eventually
        will be lost or stolen and, therefore, that the algorithms will be
        reverse engineered and become known to the adversary. Thus, one
        should rely on only those algorithms and protocols that are strong
        enough to have been published widely, and have been peer reviewed
        for long enough that their flaws have been found and removed. For
        example, NIST used a long, public process to select AES to replace
        DES.

  - 튜토리얼: 이 접근 방식은 암호화 분야에서 오랫동안 신뢰를 얻지 못했습니다. 여기서 이 문구는 단순히 키를 숨기는 것이 아니라 알고리즘을 비밀로 유지하려는 시도를 의미합니다[Schn]. 대량 생산되거나 광범위하게 사용되는 암호화 장치는 결국 분실되거나 도난당할 것이며, 따라서 알고리즘이 역엔지니어링되어 적에게 알려질 것이라고 가정해야 합니다. 따라서 널리 공개될 만큼 강력하고 오랫동안 동료 검토를 거쳐 결함이 발견되어 제거된 알고리즘과 프로토콜에만 의존해야 합니다. 예를 들어 NIST는 DES를 대체할 AES를 선택하기 위해 긴 공개 프로세스를 사용했습니다.
