      The routing table data structure contains all the information
      necessary to forward an IP data packet toward its destination.  Each
      routing table entry describes the collection of best paths to a
      particular destination.  When forwarding an IP data packet, the
      routing table entry providing the best match for the packet's IP
      destination is located.  The matching routing table entry then
      provides the next hop towards the packet's destination.  OSPF also
      provides for the existence of a default route (Destination ID =
      DefaultDestination, Address Mask =  0x00000000).  When the default
      route exists, it matches all IP destinations (although any other
      matching entry is a better match).  Finding the routing table entry
      that best matches an IP destination is further described in Section
      11.1.
