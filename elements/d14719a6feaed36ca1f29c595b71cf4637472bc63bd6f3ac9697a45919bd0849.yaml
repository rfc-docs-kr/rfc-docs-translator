      Each LSA has an LS age field.  The LS age is expressed in seconds.
      An LSA's LS age field is incremented while it is contained in a
      router's database.  Also, when copied into a Link State Update
      Packet for flooding out a particular interface, the LSA's LS age is
      incremented by InfTransDelay.
