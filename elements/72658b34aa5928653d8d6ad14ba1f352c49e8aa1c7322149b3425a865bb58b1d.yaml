          An LSA
              Each transit vertex has an associated LSA.  For router
              vertices, this is a router-LSA.  For transit networks, this
              is a network-LSA (which is actually originated by the
              network's Designated Router).  In any case, the LSA's Link
              State ID is always equal to the above Vertex ID.
