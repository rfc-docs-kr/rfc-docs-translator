     an AS may wish to delegate aggregation responsibility to another AS
     (for example, a customer may wish for its service provider to
     generate aggregated routing information on its behalf); in such
     cases, aggregation is performed by a router in the second AS
     according to the routes that it receives from the first, combined
     with configured policy information describing how those routes should
     be aggregated.
