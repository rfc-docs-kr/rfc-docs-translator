        This attribute is a unique Accounting ID to make it easy to match
        start and stop records in a log file.  The start and stop records
        for a given session MUST have the same Acct-Session-Id.  An
        Accounting-Request packet MUST have an Acct-Session-Id.  An
        Access-Request packet MAY have an Acct-Session-Id; if it does,
        then the NAS MUST use the same Acct-Session-Id in the Accounting-
        Request packets for that session.
