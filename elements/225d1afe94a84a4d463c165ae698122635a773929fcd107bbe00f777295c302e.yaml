     To further illustrate how IN-ADDR.ARPA sub-delegation will work,
     consider a company named "FOO" connected to this provider which has
     been allocated the 14-bit piece of address space which matches
     10.10.64.0 with mask 255.255.192.0. This represents all addresses in
     the range 10.10.64.0 through 10.10.127.255 and will require that the
     provider implement the following IN-ADDR.ARPA delegations:
