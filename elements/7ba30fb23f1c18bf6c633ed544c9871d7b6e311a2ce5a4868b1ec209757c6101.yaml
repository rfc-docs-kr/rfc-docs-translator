     M-SCTP_ESTABLISH primitives (see Section 1.6.3 for a description of
     management primitives) to request, indicate, and confirm the
     establishment of an SCTP association with a peer M3UA node.  In order
     to avoid redundant SCTP associations between two M3UA peers, one side
     (client) SHOULD be designated to establish the SCTP association, or
     M3UA configuration information maintained to detect redundant
     associations (e.g., via knowledge of the expected local and remote
     SCTP endpoint addresses).
