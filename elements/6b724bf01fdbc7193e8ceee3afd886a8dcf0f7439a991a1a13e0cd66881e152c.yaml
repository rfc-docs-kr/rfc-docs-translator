     In authenticated mode, the first block (16 octets) of each TWAMP-Test
     packet is encrypted using the AES Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.
     This mode does not involve any chaining, and lost, duplicated, or
     reordered packets do not cause problems with deciphering any packet
     in a TWAMP-Test session.
