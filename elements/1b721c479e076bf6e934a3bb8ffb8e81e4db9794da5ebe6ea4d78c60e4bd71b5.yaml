     As of Jan '92, a default-free routing table (for example, the routing
     tables maintained by the routers in the NSFNET backbone) contained
     approximately 4700 entries. This number reflects the current size of
     the NSFNET routing database. Historic data shows that this number, on
     average, has doubled every 10 months between 1988 and 1991. Assuming
     that this growth rate is going to persist in the foreseeable future
     (and there is no reason to assume otherwise), we expect the number of
     entries in a default-free routing table to grow to approximately
     30000 in two years time.  In the following analysis, we assume that
     the growth of the Internet has been, and will continue to be,
     exponential.
