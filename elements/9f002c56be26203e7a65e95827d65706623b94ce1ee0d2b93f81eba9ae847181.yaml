     Each Diameter application (e.g., NASREQ, Mobile IP) SHOULD define its
     service-specific AVPs that MUST be present in the Accounting-Request
     message in a section titled "Accounting AVPs".  The application MUST
     assume that the AVPs described in this document will be present in
     all Accounting messages, so only their respective service-specific
     AVPs need to be defined in that section.
