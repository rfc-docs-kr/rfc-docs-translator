                   In brief, SWS is caused by the receiver advancing the
                   right window edge whenever it has any new buffer space
                   available to receive data and by the sender using any
                   incremental window, no matter how small, to send more
                   data [TCP:5].  The result can be a stable pattern of
                   sending tiny data segments, even though both sender and
                   receiver have a large total buffer space for the
                   connection.  SWS can only occur during the transmission
                   of a large amount of data; if the connection goes
                   quiescent, the problem will disappear.  It is caused by
                   typical straightforward implementation of window
                   management, but the sender and receiver algorithms
                   given below will avoid it.
