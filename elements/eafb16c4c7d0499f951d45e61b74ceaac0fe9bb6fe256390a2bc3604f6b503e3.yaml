     The "Unsupported Traffic Mode Type" error is sent by a SGP if an ASP
     sends an ASP Active message with an unsupported Traffic Mode Type or
     a Traffic Mode Type that is inconsistent with the presently
     configured mode for the Application Server.  An example would be a
     case in which the SGP did not support loadsharing.
