          List of next hops
              The list of next hops for the current set of shortest paths
              from the root to this vertex.  There can be multiple
              shortest paths due to the equal-cost multipath capability.
              Each next hop indicates the outgoing router interface to use
              when forwarding traffic to the destination.  On broadcast,
              Point-to-MultiPoint and NBMA networks, the next hop also
              includes the IP address of the next router (if any) in the
              path towards the destination.
