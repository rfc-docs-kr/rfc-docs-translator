     This non-normative section defines a template that can be used to
     define protocol capabilities.  Data models written in YANG usually do
     not need to define protocol capabilities since the usage of YANG
     automatically leads to a capability announcing the data model and any
     optional portions of the data model, so called features in YANG
     terminology.  The capabilities template is intended to be used in
     cases where the YANG mechanisms are not powerful enough (e.g., for
     handling parameterized features) or a different data modeling
     language is used.
