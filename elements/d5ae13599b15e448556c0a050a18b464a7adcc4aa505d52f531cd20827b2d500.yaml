              o   The initialize(I), more (M) and master(MS) bits are set,
                  the contents of the packet are empty, and the neighbor's
                  Router ID is larger than the router's own.  In this case
                  the router is now Slave.  Set the master/slave bit to
                  slave, and set the neighbor data structure's DD sequence
                  number to that specified by the master.
