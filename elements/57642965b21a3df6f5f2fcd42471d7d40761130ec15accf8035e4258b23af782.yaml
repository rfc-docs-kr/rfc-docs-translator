     b) The spatial locality of popularity i.e., how requests are
        distributed throughout a network.  The importance of spatial
        locality relates to the ability to avoid redundant traffic in the
        network.  If requests are highly localized in some area of the
        entire network, then similar requests can be more efficiently
        served with mechanisms such as caching and/or multicast, i.e., the
        concentration of similar requests in a limited area of the network
        allows increasing the perceived cache hit ratios at caches in the
        area and/or the traffic savings from the use of multicast.
        Table 2 provides an overview of distributions that can be used to
        model each of the identified traffic types i.e., Web, Video (based
        on YouTube measurements), and P2P (based on BitTorrent
        measurements).  These distributions are the outcome of a series of
        modeling efforts based on measurements of real traffic workloads
