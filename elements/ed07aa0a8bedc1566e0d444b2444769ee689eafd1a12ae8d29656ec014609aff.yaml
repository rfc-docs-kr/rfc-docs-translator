     Sending an ICMP Echo Request [RFC792] would not be an acceptable way
     of testing a candidate configuration, since sending any IP packet
     generally requires an ARP Request/Reply exchange and, as explained
     above, ARP packets may not be broadcast safely until after the
     candidate configuration has been confirmed.  Also, where a host moves
     from one private network to another, an ICMP Echo Request can result
     in an ICMP Echo Response even when the MAC address has changed, as
     long as the IPv4 address remains the same.  This can occur, for
     example, where a host moves from one home network using prefix
     192.168/16 to another one.  In addition, if the ping is sent with TTL
     > 1, then an ICMP Echo Response can be received from an off-link
     router.  As a result, if the MAC address of the test node is not
     checked, the host can mistakenly confirm attachment, potentially
     resulting in an address conflict.  As a result, sending an ICMP Echo
     Request SHOULD NOT be used as a substitute for the reachability test.
