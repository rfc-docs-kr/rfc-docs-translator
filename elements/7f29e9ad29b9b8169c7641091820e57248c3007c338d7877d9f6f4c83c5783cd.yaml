     There are many ways in which these three protocols can be combined.
     This document selects one method by which FTP can operate securely,
     while providing both flexibility and interoperation.  This
     necessitates a brief description of the actual negotiation mechanism,
     a detailed description of the required policies and practices, and a

     either party to impose their security requirements on the FTP
     session.
