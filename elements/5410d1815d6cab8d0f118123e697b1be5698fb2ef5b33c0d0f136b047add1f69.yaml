     There are situations such as temporary loss of connectivity to the
     SGP that may cause the M3UA layer at the ASP to audit SS7 destination
     availability/congestion states.  Note: there is no primitive for the
     MTP3-User to request this audit from the M3UA layer, as this is
     initiated by an internal M3UA management function.
