     Note that in some cases (e.g., DH parameters) it is necessary to
     represent integers as opaque vectors.  In such cases, they are
     represented as unsigned integers (i.e., leading zero octets are not
     required even if the most significant bit is set).

  어떤 경우에는(예: DH 매개변수) 정수를 불투명 벡터로 표시해야 합니다. 그러한 경우에는 부호 없는 정수로 표시됩니다(즉, 최상위 비트가 설정되더라도 선행 0 옥텟은 필요하지 않습니다).
