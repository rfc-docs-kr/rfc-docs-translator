     In the IPSP case, MTP restart could be considered if the IPSP also
     has connection to an SS7 network.  In that case, the same behavior as
     described above for the SGP would apply to the restarting IPSP.  This
     would also be the case if the IPSPs were perceived as exchanging MTP
     Peer PDUs, instead of MTP primitives between MTP User and MTP
     Provider.  In other words, M3UA does not provide the equivalent to
     Traffic Restart Allowed messages indicating the end of the restart
     procedure between peer IPSPs that would also be connected to an SS7
     network.
