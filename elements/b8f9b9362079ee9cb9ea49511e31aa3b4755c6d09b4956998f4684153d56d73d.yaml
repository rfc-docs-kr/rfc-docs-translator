          Next, by looking at the area summaries from these area border
          routers, RT3 and RT4 can determine the distance to all networks
          outside their area.  These distances are then advertised
          internally to the area by RT3 and RT4.  The advertisements that
          Router RT3 and RT4 will make into Area 1 are shown in Table 6.
          Note that Table 6 assumes that an area range has been configured
          for the backbone which groups Ia and Ib into a single LSA.
