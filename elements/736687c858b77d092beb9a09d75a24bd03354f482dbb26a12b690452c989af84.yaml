     Throughout this standard, where FWS (the folding white space token)
     appears, it indicates a place where header folding, as discussed in
     section 2.2.3, may take place.  Wherever header folding appears in a
     message (that is, a header field body containing a CRLF followed by
     any WSP), header unfolding (removal of the CRLF) is performed before
     any further lexical analysis is performed on that header field
     according to this standard.  That is to say, any CRLF that appears in
     FWS is semantically "invisible."

  이 표준 전체에서 FWS(접이식 공백 토큰)가 나타나는 곳은 섹션 2.2.3에서 설명한 대로 헤더 접기가 발생할 수 있는 위치를 나타냅니다.  메시지에 헤더 접기가 나타날 때마다(즉, WSP 뒤에 CRLF가 포함된 헤더 필드 본문) 헤더 전개(CRLF 제거)는 이 표준에 따라 해당 헤더 필드에 대한 추가 어휘 분석이 수행되기 전에 수행됩니다.  즉, FWS에 나타나는 모든 CRLF는 의미상 "보이지 않습니다".
