     The possibility exists for Session-Sender failure during a session,
     or the path between the Session-Sender and Session-Reflector may fail
     while a test session is in progress.  The Session-Reflector MAY
     discontinue any session that has been started when no packet
     associated with that session has been received for REFWAIT seconds.
     The default value of REFWAIT SHALL be 900 seconds, and this waiting
     time MAY be configurable.  This timeout allows a Session-Reflector to
     free up resources in case of failure.
