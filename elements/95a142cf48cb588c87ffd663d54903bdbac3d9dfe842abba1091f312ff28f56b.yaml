                There is also an architectural argument for embedded
                gateway functionality: multihoming is much more common
                than originally foreseen, and multihoming forces a host to
                make routing decisions as if it were a gateway.  If the
                multihomed  host contains an embedded gateway, it will
                have full routing knowledge and as a result will be able
                to make more optimal routing decisions.
