        The Diameter protocol requires that agents maintain transaction
        state, which is used for failover purposes.  Transaction state
        implies that upon forwarding a request, the Hop-by-Hop Identifier
        is saved; the field is replaced with a locally unique identifier,
        which is restored to its original value when the corresponding
        answer is received.  The request's state is released upon receipt
        of the answer.  A stateless agent is one that only maintains
        transaction state.
