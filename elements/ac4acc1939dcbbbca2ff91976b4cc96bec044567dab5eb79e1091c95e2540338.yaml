     Over the last few years, there have been several serious attacks on
     Transport Layer Security (TLS), including attacks on its most
     commonly used ciphers and modes of operation.  This document
     summarizes these attacks, with the goal of motivating generic and
     protocol-specific recommendations on the usage of TLS and Datagram
     TLS (DTLS).
