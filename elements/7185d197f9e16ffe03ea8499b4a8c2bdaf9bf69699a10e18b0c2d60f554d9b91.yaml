      When used in Hello packets, the Options field allows a router to
      reject a neighbor because of a capability mismatch.  Alternatively,
      when capabilities are exchanged in Database Description packets a
      router can choose not to forward certain LSAs to a neighbor because
      of its reduced functionality.  Lastly, listing capabilities in LSAs
      allows routers to forward traffic around reduced functionality
      routers, by excluding them from parts of the routing table
      calculation.
