          (8) When the state of one of the router's configured virtual
              links changes, it may be necessary to originate a new
              router-LSA into the virtual link's Transit area (see the
              discussion of the router-LSA's bit V in Section 12.4.1), as
              well as originating a new router-LSA into the backbone.
