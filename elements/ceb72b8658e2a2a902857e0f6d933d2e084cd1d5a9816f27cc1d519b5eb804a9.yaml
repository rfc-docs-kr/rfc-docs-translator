     TLS is now used in an increasing variety of operational environments,
     many of which were not envisioned when the original design criteria
     for TLS were determined.  The extensions introduced in this document
     are designed to enable TLS to operate as effectively as possible in
     new environments such as wireless networks.

  TLS는 이제 점점 더 다양한 운영 환경에서 사용되고 있으며, 그 중 많은 환경은 TLS의 원래 설계 기준이 결정될 때 구상되지 않았습니다. 이 문서에 소개된 확장은 무선 네트워크와 같은 새로운 환경에서 TLS가 최대한 효과적으로 작동할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.
