        In general, the advantage of abstracting routing information at a
        given level of the routing hierarchy is greater at the higher
        levels of the hierarchy. There is relatively little direct benefit
        to the administration that performs the abstraction, since it must
        maintain routing information individually on each attached
        topological routing structure.
