          When a new (and more recent) LSA has been received, it must be
          flooded out some set of the router's interfaces.  This section
          describes the second part of flooding procedure (the first part
          being the processing that occurred in Section 13), namely,
          selecting the outgoing interfaces and adding the LSA to the
          appropriate neighbors' Link state retransmission lists.  Also
          included in this part of the flooding procedure is the
          maintenance of the neighbors' Link state request lists.
