     The Diameter base protocol satisfies the minimum requirements for a
     AAA protocol, as specified by [RFC2989].  The base protocol may be
     used by itself for accounting purposes only, or it may be used with a
     Diameter application, such as Mobile IPv4 [RFC4004], or network
     access [RFC4005].  It is also possible for the base protocol to be
     extended for use in new applications, via the addition of new
     commands or AVPs.  The initial focus of Diameter was network access
     and accounting applications.  A truly generic AAA protocol used by
     many applications might provide functionality not provided by
     Diameter.  Therefore, it is imperative that the designers of new
     applications understand their requirements before using Diameter.
     See Section 1.3.4 for more information on Diameter applications.
