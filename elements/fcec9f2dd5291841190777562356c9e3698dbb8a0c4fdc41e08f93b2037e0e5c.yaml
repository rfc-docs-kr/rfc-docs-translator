      ExternalRoutingCapability
          Whether AS-external-LSAs will be flooded into/throughout the
          area.  This is a configurable parameter.  If AS-external-LSAs
          are excluded from the area, the area is called a "stub". Within
          stub areas, routing to AS external destinations will be based
          solely on a default summary route.  The backbone cannot be
          configured as a stub area.  Also, virtual links cannot be
          configured through stub areas.  For more information, see
          Section 3.6.
