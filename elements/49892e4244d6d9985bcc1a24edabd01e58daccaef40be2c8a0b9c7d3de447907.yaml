              DISCUSSION
                   Hosts that casually send Address Mask Replies with
                   invalid address masks have often been a serious
                   nuisance.  To prevent this, Address Mask Replies ought
                   to be sent only by authoritative agents that have been
                   selected by explicit administrative action.
