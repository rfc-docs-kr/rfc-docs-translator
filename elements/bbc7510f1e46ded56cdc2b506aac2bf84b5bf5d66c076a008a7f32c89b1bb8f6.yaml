              When using Cryptographic authentication, there may be
              multiple keys configured for the interface. In this case,
              among the keys that are valid for message generation (i.e,
              that have KeyStartGenerate <= current time <
              KeyStopGenerate) choose the one with the most recent
              KeyStartGenerate time. Using this key, modify the packet as
              follows:
"fixed": !!null |-
  null
"ko": !!null |-
  null
