     If the MGC sets an EventsDescriptor containing a hook state
     transition event (on-hook or off-hook) with the "strict" (0x0001)
     parameter set to "failWrong", and the hook state is already what the
     transition implies, the execution of the command containing that
     EventsDescriptor fails.  The MG SHALL include error code 540
     "Unexpected initial hook state" in its reponse.
