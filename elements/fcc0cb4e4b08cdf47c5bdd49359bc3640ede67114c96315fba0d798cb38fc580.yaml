     For most TCP/IP hosts, TU port range 0-1023 is used by servers
     listening for incoming connections. Clients trying to initiate a
     connection typically select a source TU port in the range of 1024-
     65535. However, this convention is not universal and not always
     followed. Some client stations initiate connections using a source TU
     port number in the range of 0-1023, and there are servers listening
     on TU port numbers in the range of 1024-65535.
