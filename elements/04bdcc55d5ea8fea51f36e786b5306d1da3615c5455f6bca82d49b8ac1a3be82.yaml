     Thanks to Mike Eisler for his work on the Channel Conjunction
     Mechanism document and for bringing the problem to a head, Sam
     Hartman for pointing out that channel binding provides a general
     solution to the channel binding problem, and Jeff Altman for his
     suggestion of using the TLS finished messages as the TLS channel
     bindings.  Also, thanks to Bill Sommerfeld, Radia Perlman, Simon
     Josefsson, Joe Salowey, Eric Rescorla, Michael Richardson, Bernard
     Aboba, Tom Petch, Mark Brown, and many others.

  Channel Conjunction Mechanism 문서 작업과 문제를 해결한 Mike Eisler, 채널 바인딩이 채널 바인딩 문제에 대한 일반적인 솔루션을 제공한다는 점을 지적한 Sam Hartman, TLS 사용을 제안한 Jeff Altman에게 감사드립니다. 완료된 메시지를 TLS 채널 바인딩으로 사용합니다. 또한 Bill Sommerfeld, Radia Perlman, Simon Josefsson, Joe Salowey, Eric Rescorla, Michael Richardson, Bernard Aboba, Tom Petch, Mark Brown 및 기타 많은 분들께도 감사드립니다.
