        Accounting-Response packets are sent by the RADIUS accounting
        server to the client to acknowledge that the Accounting-Request
        has been received and recorded successfully.  If the Accounting-
        Request was recorded successfully then the RADIUS accounting
        server MUST transmit a packet with the Code field set to 5
        (Accounting-Response).  On reception of an Accounting-Response by
        the client, the Identifier field is matched with a pending
        Accounting-Request.  The Response Authenticator field MUST contain
        the correct response for the pending Accounting-Request.  Invalid
        packets are silently discarded.
