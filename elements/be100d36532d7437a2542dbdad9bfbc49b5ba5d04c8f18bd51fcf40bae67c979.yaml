     Note that if a signature can be forged over an arbitrary credential,
     the attacker can choose any value for the valid_time field.  Repeated
     signature forgeries therefore allow the attacker to create multiple
     delegated credentials that can cover the entire validity period of
     the certificate.  Temporary exposure of the key or a signing oracle
     may allow the attacker to impersonate a server for the lifetime of
     the certificate.
