          After the shortest-path tree has been calculated for the
          backbone in Section 16.1, Router RT1 (left end of the virtual
          link) will have calculated a path through Router RT4 for all
          data traffic destined for Network N1. However, since Router RT5
          is so much closer to Network N1, all routers internal to Area 1
          (e.g., Routers RT2 and RT3) will forward their Network N1
          traffic towards Router RT5, instead of RT4. And indeed, after
          examining Area 1's summary-LSAs by the above calculation, Router
          RT1 will also forward Network N1 traffic towards RT5. Note that
          in this example the virtual link enables transit data traffic to
          be forwarded through Area 1, but the actual path the transit
          data traffic takes does not follow the virtual link.  In other
          words, virtual links allow transit traffic to be forwarded
          through an area, but do not dictate the precise path that the
          traffic will take.
