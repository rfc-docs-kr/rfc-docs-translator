     This family of threats has a vast membership, many of which are
     critical.  As a converse to the registration hijacking threat,
     consider the case in which a registration sent to biloxi.com is
     intercepted by chicago.com, which replies to the intercepted
     registration with a forged 301 (Moved Permanently) response.  This
     response might seem to come from biloxi.com yet designate chicago.com
     as the appropriate registrar.  All future REGISTER requests from the
     originating UA would then go to chicago.com.

  이 위협군은 광범위한 구성원을 보유하고 있으며 그 중 다수는 매우 중요합니다. 등록 하이재킹 위협과 반대로, biloxi.com으로 전송된 등록이 Chicago.com에 의해 차단되고, 차단된 등록에 대해 위조된 301(영구적으로 이동됨) 응답으로 응답하는 경우를 생각해 보십시오. 이 응답은 biloxi.com에서 나온 것처럼 보이지만 Chicago.com을 적절한 등록 기관으로 지정합니다. 원래 UA의 모든 향후 REGISTER 요청은 Chicago.com으로 이동됩니다.
