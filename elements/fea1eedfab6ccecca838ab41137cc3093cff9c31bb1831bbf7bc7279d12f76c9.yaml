        "Residual Session Context Removed" is sent in response to a
        Disconnect-Request if one or more user sessions are no longer
        active, but residual session context was found and successfully
        removed.  This value is only sent within a Disconnect-ACK and MUST
        NOT be sent within a CoA-ACK, Disconnect-NAK, or CoA-NAK.
