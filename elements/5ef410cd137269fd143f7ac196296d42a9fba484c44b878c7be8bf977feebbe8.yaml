     Within or associated with each authenticator, it is not anticipated
     that a particular named peer will support a choice of methods.  This
     would make the peer vulnerable to attacks that negotiate the least
     secure method from among a set.  Instead, for each named peer, there
     SHOULD be an indication of exactly one method used to authenticate
     that peer name.  If a peer needs to make use of different
     authentication methods under different circumstances, then distinct
     identities SHOULD be employed, each of which identifies exactly one
     authentication method.
