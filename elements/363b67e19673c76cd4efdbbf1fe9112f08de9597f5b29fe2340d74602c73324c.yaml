     An empty leaf node within a filter is called a "selection node", and
     it represents an "explicit selection" filter on the underlying data
     model.  Presence of any selection nodes within a set of sibling nodes
     will cause the filter to select the specified subtree(s) and suppress
     automatic selection of the entire set of sibling nodes in the
     underlying data model.  For filtering purposes, an empty leaf node
     can be declared either with an empty tag (e.g., <foo/>) or with
     explicit start and end tags (e.g., <foo> </foo>).  Any whitespace
     characters are ignored in this form.
