     information along topological lines.  For simple, single-homed
     clients, the allocation of their address space out of a transit
     routing domain's space will accomplish this automatically - rather
     than advertise a separate route for each such client, the transit
     domain may advertise a single aggregate route which describes all of
     the destinations connected to it. Unfortunately, not all sites are
     singly-connected to the network, so some loss of ability to aggregate
     is realized for the non-trivial cases.
