     Receive Timestamp is the time the test packet was received by the
     reflector.  The difference between Timestamp and Receive Timestamp is
     the amount of time the packet was in transition in the Session-
     Reflector.  The Error Estimate associated with the Timestamp field
     also applies to the Receive Timestamp.
