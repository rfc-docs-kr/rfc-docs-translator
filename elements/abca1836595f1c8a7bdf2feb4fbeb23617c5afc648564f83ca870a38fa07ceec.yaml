     ECN counts are only incremented when QUIC packets from the received
     IP packet are processed.  As such, duplicate QUIC packets are not
     processed and do not increase ECN counts; see Section 21.10 for
     relevant security concerns.

  ECN 수는 수신된 IP 패킷의 QUIC 패킷이 처리될 때만 증가됩니다. 따라서 중복된 QUIC 패킷은 처리되지 않으며 ECN 수를 늘리지 않습니다. 관련 보안 문제는 섹션 21.10을 참조하세요.
