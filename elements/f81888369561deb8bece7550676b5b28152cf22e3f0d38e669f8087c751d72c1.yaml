     The EventsDescriptor parameter contains a RequestIdentifier and a
     list of events that the Media Gateway is requested to detect and
     report.  The RequestIdentifier is used to correlate the request with
     the notifications that it may trigger.  Requested events include, for
     example, fax tones, continuity test results, and on-hook and off-hook
     transitions.
