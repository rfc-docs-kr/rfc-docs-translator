          Each network (stub or transit) in the graph has an IP address
          and associated network mask.  The mask indicates the number of
          nodes on the network.  Hosts attached directly to routers
          (referred to as host routes) appear on the graph as stub
          networks.  The network mask for a host route is always
          0xffffffff, which indicates the presence of a single node.
