      Associated router interfaces
          This router's interfaces connecting to the area.  A router
          interface belongs to one and only one area (or the backbone).
          For the backbone area this list includes all the virtual links.
          A virtual link is identified by the Router ID of its other
          endpoint; its cost is the cost of the shortest intra-area path
          through the Transit area that exists between the two routers.
