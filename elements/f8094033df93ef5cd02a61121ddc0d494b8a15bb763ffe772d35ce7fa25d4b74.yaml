     Example: If the block length is 8 bytes, the content length
              (TLSCompressed.length) is 61 bytes, and the MAC length is 20
              bytes, then the length before padding is 82 bytes (this does
              not include the IV, which may or may not be encrypted, as
              discussed above).  Thus, the padding length modulo 8 must be
              equal to 6 in order to make the total length an even
              multiple of 8 bytes (the block length).  The padding length
              can be 6, 14, 22, and so on, through 254.  If the padding
              length were the minimum necessary, 6, the padding would be 6
              bytes, each containing the value 6.  Thus, the last 8 octets
              of the GenericBlockCipher before block encryption would be
              xx 06 06 06 06 06 06 06, where xx is the last octet of the
              MAC.
