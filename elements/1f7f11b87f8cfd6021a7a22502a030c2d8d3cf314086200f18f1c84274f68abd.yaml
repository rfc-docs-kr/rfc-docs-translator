           Internet hosts span a wide range of size, speed, and function.
           They range in size from small microprocessors through
           workstations to mainframes and supercomputers.  In function,
           they range from single-purpose hosts (such as terminal servers)
           to full-service hosts that support a variety of online network
           services, typically including remote login, file transfer, and
           electronic mail.
