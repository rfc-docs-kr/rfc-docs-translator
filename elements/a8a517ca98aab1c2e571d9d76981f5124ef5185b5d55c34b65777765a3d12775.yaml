           *  Location:  Disc resident
           *  Coupling:  Coupled to both a user process virtual space and
              the
                            network process virtual space.
           *  Content: - Input buffer (253 words) for incoming messages
                        - Output buffer (253 words) for outgoing messages
                        - Input control zone (6 half words)
                        - Output control zone (6 half words)
           *  Structure:  See figure 10.
           *  Specific feature 1: - The input buffer is filled by the
                                    Network and emptied by the user.
                                  - Vice versa for the output buffer.
           *  Specific feature 2:  The control zone corresponding to a
                                    primary connection shared page differs
                                    from that of an auxiliary connection.
                                    This because it is via a "primary
                                    connection control zone" that
                                    auxiliary connection establishment
                                    requests are transmitted to the
                                    Network process.
