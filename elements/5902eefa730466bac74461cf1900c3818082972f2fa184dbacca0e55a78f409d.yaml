            (a) The cipher may use a fixed mask such as zero.
            (b) The CBC residue from the previous record may be used as
                the mask.  This preserves maximum code compatibility with
                TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.  It also has the advantage that it does
                not require the ability to quickly reset the IV, which is
                known to be a problem on some systems.
