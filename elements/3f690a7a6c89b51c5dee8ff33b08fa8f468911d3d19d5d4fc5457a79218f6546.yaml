     A physical MG may have only one network interface, which must be
     shared across virtual MGs.  In such a case, the packet/cell side
     Termination is shared.  It should be noted however, that in use, such
     interfaces require an ephemeral instance of the Termination to be
     created per flow, and thus sharing the Termination is
     straightforward.  This mechanism does lead to a complication, namely
     that the MG must always know which of its controlling MGCs should be
     notified if an event occurs on the interface.
