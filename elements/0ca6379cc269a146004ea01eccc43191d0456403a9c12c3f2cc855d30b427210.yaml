     [b] As discussed in [RFC3579], the authenticator is dependent on the
         AAA protocol in order to know the outcome of an authentication
         conversation, and does not look at the encapsulated EAP packet
         (if one is present) to determine the outcome.  In practice, this
         implies that the AAA protocol spoken between the authenticator
         and authentication server MUST support per-packet authentication,
         integrity, and replay protection.
