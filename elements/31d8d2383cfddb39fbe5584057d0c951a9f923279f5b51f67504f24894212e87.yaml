     o  It is now required in Section 5.1 that if the Type-Data field of
        an Identity Request contains a NUL-character, only the part before
        the null is displayed.  RFC 2284 prohibits the null termination of
        the Type-Data field of Identity messages.  This rule has been
        relaxed for Identity Request messages and the Identity Request
        Type-Data field may now be null terminated.
