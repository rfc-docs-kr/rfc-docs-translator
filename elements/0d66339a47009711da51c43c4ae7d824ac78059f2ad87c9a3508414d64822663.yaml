              To efficiently route a series of datagrams to the same
              destination, the source host MUST keep a "route cache" of
              mappings to next-hop gateways.  A host uses the following
              basic algorithm on this cache to route a datagram; this
              algorithm is designed to put the primary routing burden on
              the gateways [IP:11].
