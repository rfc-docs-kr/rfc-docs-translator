              The LS type field dictates the format and function of the
              LSA.  LSAs of different types have different names (e.g.,
              router-LSAs or network-LSAs).  All LSA types defined by this
              memo, except the AS-external-LSAs (LS type = 5), are flooded
              throughout a single area only.  AS-external-LSAs are flooded
              throughout the entire Autonomous System, excepting stub
              areas (see Section 3.6).  Each separate LSA type is briefly
              described below in Table 15.
