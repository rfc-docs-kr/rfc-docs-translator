     The SCTP Payload Protocol Identifier value "3" SHOULD be included in
     each SCTP DATA chunk, to indicate that the SCTP is carrying the M3UA
     protocol.  The value "0" (unspecified) is also allowed but any other
     values MUST not be used.  This Payload Protocol Identifier is not
     directly used by SCTP but MAY be used by certain network entities to
     identify the type of information being carried in a DATA chunk.
