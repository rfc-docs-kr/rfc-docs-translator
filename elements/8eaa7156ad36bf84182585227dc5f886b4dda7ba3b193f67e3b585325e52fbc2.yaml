     A receiver of a Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER) message that does
     not have any applications in common with the sender MUST return a
     Capabilities-Exchange-Answer (CEA) with the Result-Code AVP set to
     DIAMETER_NO_COMMON_APPLICATION and SHOULD disconnect the transport
     layer connection.  Note that receiving a CER or CEA from a peer
     advertising itself as a relay (see Section 2.4) MUST be interpreted
     as having common applications with the peer.
