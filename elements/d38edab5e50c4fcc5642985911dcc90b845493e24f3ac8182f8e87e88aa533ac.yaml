     From the perspective of the M3UA layer at an ASP, a particular SG is
     capable of transferring traffic to a provisioned SS7 destination X if
     an SCTP association with at least one SGP of the SG is established,
     the SGP has returned an acknowledgement to the ASP to indicate that
     the ASP is actively handling traffic for that destination X, the SGP
     has not indicated that the destination X is inaccessible, and the SGP
     has not indicated MTP Restart.  When an ASP is configured to use
     multiple SGPs for transferring traffic to the SS7 network, the ASP
     must maintain knowledge of the current capability of the SGPs to
     handle traffic to destinations of interest.  This information is
     crucial to the overall reliability of the service, for active/backup,
     loadsharing, and broadcast models, in the event of failures and
     recovery and maintenance activities.  The ASP M3UA may also use this
     information for congestion avoidance purposes.  The distribution of
     the MTP3-user messages over the SGPs should be done in such a way as
     to minimize message missequencing, as required by the SS7 User Parts.
