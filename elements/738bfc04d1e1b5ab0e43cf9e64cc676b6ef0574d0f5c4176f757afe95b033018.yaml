        NIST reminds all interested parties that the adoption of AES is
        being conducted as an open standards-setting activity.
        Specifically, NIST has requested that all interested parties
        identify to NIST any patents or inventions that may be required
        for the use of AES.  NIST hereby gives public notice that it may
        seek redress under the antitrust laws of the United States against
        any party in the future who might seek to exercise patent rights
        against any user of AES that have not been disclosed to NIST in
        response to this request for information.
