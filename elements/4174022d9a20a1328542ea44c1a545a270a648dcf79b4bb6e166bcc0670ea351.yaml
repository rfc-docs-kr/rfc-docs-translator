          Possible values: a list of signals and/or sequential signal
          lists which have terminated.  A signal outside of a sequential
          signal list shall be identified using the pkgdName syntax
          without wildcarding.  An individual signal inside of a
          sequential signal list shall be identified using the sequential
          signal list syntax with the correct signal list identifier,
          enclosing the name of the specific signal which terminated in
          pkgdName syntax.
