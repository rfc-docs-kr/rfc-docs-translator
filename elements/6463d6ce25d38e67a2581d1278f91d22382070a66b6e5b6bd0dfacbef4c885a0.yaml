     The M3UA layer at both the SGP and ASP also supports the assignment
     of signalling traffic into streams within an SCTP association.
     Traffic that requires sequencing SHOULD be assigned to the same
     stream.  To accomplish this, MTP3-User traffic may be assigned to
     individual streams based on, for example, the SLS value in the MTP3
     Routing Label, subject of course to the maximum number of streams
     supported by the underlying SCTP association.
