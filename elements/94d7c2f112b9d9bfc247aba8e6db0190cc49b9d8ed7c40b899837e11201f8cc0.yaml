     The NETCONF protocol is a building block in a system of automated
     configuration.  XML is the lingua franca of interchange, providing a
     flexible but fully specified encoding mechanism for hierarchical
     content.  NETCONF can be used in concert with XML-based
     transformation technologies, such as XSLT [W3C.REC-xslt-19991116], to
     provide a system for automated generation of full and partial
     configurations.  The system can query one or more databases for data
     about networking topologies, links, policies, customers, and
     services.  This data can be transformed using one or more XSLT
     scripts from a task-oriented, vendor-independent data schema into a
     form that is specific to the vendor, product, operating system, and
     software release.  The resulting data can be passed to the device
     using the NETCONF protocol.
