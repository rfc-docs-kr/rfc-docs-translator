     Conceptually, a subtree filter is comprised of zero or more element
     subtrees, which represent the filter selection criteria.  At each
     containment level within a subtree, the set of sibling nodes is
     logically processed by the server to determine if its subtree and
     path of elements to the root are included in the filter output.
