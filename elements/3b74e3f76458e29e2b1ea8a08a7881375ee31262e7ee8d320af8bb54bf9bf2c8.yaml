     Note: Protocol designers should try to reuse existing functionality,
     namely AVP values, AVPs, commands, and Diameter applications.  Reuse
     simplifies standardization and implementation.  To avoid potential
     interoperability issues, it is important to ensure that the semantics
     of the reused features are well understood.  Given that Diameter can
     also carry RADIUS attributes as Diameter AVPs, such reuse
     considerations also apply to existing RADIUS attributes that may be
     useful in a Diameter application.
