                   o    Packets arriving from a particular link-layer
                        address are evidence that the system at this
                        address is alive.  However, turning this
                        information into advice about gateways requires
                        mapping the link-layer address into an IP address,
                        and then checking that IP address against the
                        gateways pointed to by the route cache.  This is
                        probably prohibitively inefficient.
