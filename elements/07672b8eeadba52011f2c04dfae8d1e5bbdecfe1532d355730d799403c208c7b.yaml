        For purposes of external routing of traffic from outside MBII to a
        destination inside of MBII, this approach works similarly to
        treating MBII as six separate organizations. For purposes of
        internal routing, or for routing traffic from inside of MBII to a
        destination outside of MBII, this approach works the same as the
        first solution.
