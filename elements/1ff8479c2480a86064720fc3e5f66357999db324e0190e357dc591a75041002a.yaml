     This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
     MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
     translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
     equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because there
     is no translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-
     readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual
     descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this
     loss of machine readable information is not considered to change the
     semantics of the MIB.
