     The Session-Timeout AVP (AVP Code 27) [RFC2865] is of type Unsigned32
     and contains the maximum number of seconds of service to be provided
     to the user before termination of the session.  When both the
     Session-Timeout and the Authorization-Lifetime AVPs are present in an
     answer message, the former MUST be equal to or greater than the value
     of the latter.
