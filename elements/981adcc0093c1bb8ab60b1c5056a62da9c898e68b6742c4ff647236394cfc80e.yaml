     While the JPEG standard provides a rich set of algorithms for
     flexible compression, cost-effective hardware implementations of the
     full standard have not appeared.  Instead, most hardware JPEG video
     codecs implement only a subset of the sequential DCT mode of
     operation.  Typically, marker segments are interpreted in software
     (which "re-programs" the hardware) and the hardware is presented with
     a single, interleaved entropy-coded scan represented in the YUV color
     space.
