     -- In PropertyParm, value is a SEQUENCE OF octet string.  When sent
     -- by an MGC the interpretation is as follows:
     -- empty sequence means CHOOSE
     -- one element sequence specifies value
     -- If the sublist field is not selected, a longer sequence means
     -- "choose one of the values" (i.e. value1 OR value2 OR ...)
     -- If the sublist field is selected,
     -- a sequence with more than one element encodes the value of a
     -- list-valued property (i.e. value1 AND value2 AND ...).
     -- The relation field may only be selected if the value sequence
     -- has length 1.  It indicates that the MG has to choose a value
     -- for the property. E.g., x > 3 (using the greaterThan
