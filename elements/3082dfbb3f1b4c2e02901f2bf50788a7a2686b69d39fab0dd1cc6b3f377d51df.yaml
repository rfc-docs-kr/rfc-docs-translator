     Both NETCONF peers MUST verify that the other peer has advertised a
     common protocol version.  When comparing protocol version capability
     URIs, only the base part is used, in the event any parameters are
     encoded at the end of the URI string.  If no protocol version
     capability in common is found, the NETCONF peer MUST NOT continue the
     session.  If more than one protocol version URI in common is present,
     then the highest numbered (most recent) protocol version MUST be used
     by both peers.
