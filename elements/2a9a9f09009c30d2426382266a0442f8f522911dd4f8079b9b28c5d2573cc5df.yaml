                It has been suggested that a host could determine the MTU
                over a given path by sending a zero-offset datagram
                fragment and waiting for the receiver to time out the
                reassembly (which cannot complete!) and return an ICMP
                Time Exceeded message.  This message would include the
                largest remaining fragment header in its body.  More
                direct mechanisms are being experimented with, but have
                not yet been adopted (see e.g., RFC-1063).
