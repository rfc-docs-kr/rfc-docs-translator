      OSPF recalculates routes quickly in the face of topological changes,
      utilizing a minimum of routing protocol traffic.  OSPF provides
      support for equal-cost multipath.  An area routing capability is
      provided, enabling an additional level of routing protection and a
      reduction in routing protocol traffic.  In addition, all OSPF
      routing protocol exchanges are authenticated.
