     A variation of the Zipf distribution, termed the Mandelbrot-Zipf
     distribution was suggested [Saleh06] to better model environments
     where nodes can locally store previously requested content.  For
     example, it was observed that peer-to-peer file-sharing applications
     typically exhibited a 'fetch-at-most-once' style of behavior.  This
     is because peers tend to persistently store the files they download,
     a behavior that may also be prevalent in ICN.
