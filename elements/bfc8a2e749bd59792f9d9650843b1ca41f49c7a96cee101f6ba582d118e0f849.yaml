     This section outlines the changes between this document and its
     precdecessor, RFC 2035.  The changes to the protocol were made with
     an eye towards causing as few interoperability problems between
     implementations based on the older text and newer implementations,
     and indeed, many of the obsolete conventions can still be
     unambiguously decoded by a newer implementation.  However, use of the
     older conventions in newer implementations is strongly discouraged.
