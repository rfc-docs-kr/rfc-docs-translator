     SSH is susceptible to the same man-in-the-middle attack on the first
     exchange of keys; however, it is widely acknowledged that while SSH
     is not perfect, it does improve the security of connections.  The use
     of key fingerprints could provide some assistance to SIP, just as it
     does for SSH.  For example, if two parties use SIP to establish a
     voice communications session, each could read off the fingerprint of
     the key they received from the other, which could be compared against
     the original.  It would certainly be more difficult for the man-in-
     the-middle to emulate the voices of the participants than their
     signaling (a practice that was used with the Clipper chip-based
     secure telephone).

  SSH는 첫 번째 키 교환에서 동일한 중간자 공격에 취약합니다. 그러나 SSH가 완벽하지는 않지만 연결 보안을 향상시킨다는 사실은 널리 알려져 있습니다. 키 지문을 사용하면 SSH와 마찬가지로 SIP에도 어느 정도 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 두 당사자가 SIP를 사용하여 음성 통신 세션을 설정하는 경우 각 당사자는 상대방으로부터 받은 키의 지문을 판독하여 원본과 비교할 수 있습니다. 중간자가 신호를 보내는 것보다 참가자의 목소리를 모방하는 것이 확실히 더 어려울 것입니다(Clipper 칩 기반 보안 전화에서 사용되는 방식).
