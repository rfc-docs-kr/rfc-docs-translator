        These solutions also have different effects on policies. For
        example, suppose that country "X" has a law that traffic from a
        source within country X to a destination within country X must at
        all times stay entirely within the country. With the first
        solution, it is not possible to determine from the destination
        address whether or not the destination is within the country. With
        the second solution, a separate address may be assigned to those
        hosts which are within country X, thereby allowing routing
        policies to be followed.  Similarly, suppose that "Little Small
        Company" (LSC) has a policy that its packets may never be sent to
        a destination that is within MBII. With either solution, the
        routers within LSC may be configured to discard any traffic that
        has a destination within MBII's address space. However, with the
        first solution this requires one entry; with the second it
        requires many entries and may be impossible as a practical matter.
