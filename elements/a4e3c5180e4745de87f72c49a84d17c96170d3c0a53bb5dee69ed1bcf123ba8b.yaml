     An interface has an ingress and an egress direction, and will
     generally have a different policy in each direction.  As traffic
     enters an edge interface, it may be classified, metered, counted, and
     marked.  Traffic leaving the same interface might be remarked
     according to the contract with the next network, queued to manage the
     bandwidth, and so on.  As [MODEL] points out, the functional datapath
     elements used on ingress and egress are of the same type, but may be
     structured in very different ways to implement the relevant policies.
