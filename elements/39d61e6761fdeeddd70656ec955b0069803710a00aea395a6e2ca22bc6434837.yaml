     As noted in Section 2.1, EAP does not permit untunneled sequences of
     authentication methods.  Were a sequence of EAP authentication
     methods to be permitted, the peer might not have proof that a single
     entity has acted as the authenticator for all EAP methods within the
     sequence.  For example, an authenticator might terminate one EAP
     method, then forward the next method in the sequence to another party
     without the peer's knowledge or consent.  Similarly, the
     authenticator might not have proof that a single entity has acted as
     the peer for all EAP methods within the sequence.
