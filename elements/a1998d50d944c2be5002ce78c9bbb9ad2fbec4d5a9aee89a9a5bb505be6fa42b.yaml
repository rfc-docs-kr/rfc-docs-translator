           There MUST be a reassembly timeout.  The reassembly timeout
           value SHOULD be a fixed value, not set from the remaining TTL.
           It is recommended that the value lie between 60 seconds and 120
           seconds.  If this timeout expires, the partially-reassembled
           datagram MUST be discarded and an ICMP Time Exceeded message
           sent to the source host (if fragment zero has been received).
