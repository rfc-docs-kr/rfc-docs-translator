                        This view de-emphasizes the ES/IS distinction, and
                        would therefore substitute MUST NOT for MAY in
                        issues (A) and (B).  This model may be the more
                        natural one for hosts that wiretap gateway routing
                        protocols, and is necessary for hosts that have
                        embedded gateway functionality.
