     If no other ASPs in the Application Server are in the state ASP-
     ACTIVE, the SGP MUST send a Notify message ("AS-Pending") to all ASPs
     in the AS that are in the state ASP-INACTIVE.  The SGP SHOULD start
     buffering the incoming messages for T(r) seconds, after which
     messages MAY be discarded.  T(r) is configurable by the network
     operator.  If the SGP receives an ASP Active message from an ASP in
     the AS before expiry of T(r), the buffered traffic is directed to
     that ASP, and the timer is cancelled.  If T(r) expires, the AS is
     moved to the AS-INACTIVE state.
