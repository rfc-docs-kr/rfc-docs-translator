        In addition, the PBSZ (protection buffer size) command, as
        detailed in [RFC-2228], is compulsory prior to any PROT command.
        This document also defines a data channel encapsulation mechanism
        for protected data buffers.  For FTP-TLS, which appears to the FTP
        application as a streaming protection mechanism, this is not
        required.  Thus, the PBSZ command MUST still be issued, but must
        have a parameter of '0' to indicate that no buffering is taking
        place and the data connection should not be encapsulated.
