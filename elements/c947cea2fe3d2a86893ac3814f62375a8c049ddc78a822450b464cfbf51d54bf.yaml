     Data modeling and content issues are outside the scope of the NETCONF
     protocol.  An assumption is made that the device's data model is
     well-known to the application and that both parties are aware of
     issues such as the layout, containment, keying, lookup, replacement,
     and management of the data, as well as any other constraints imposed
     by the data model.
