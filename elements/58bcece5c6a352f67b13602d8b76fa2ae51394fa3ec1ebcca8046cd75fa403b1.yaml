     Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] defines a
     mechanism for NAT traversal for multimedia communication protocols
     based on the offer/answer model [RFC3264] of session negotiation.
     ICE works by providing a set of candidate transport addresses for
     each media stream, which are then validated with peer-to-peer
     connectivity checks based on Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
     (STUN) [RFC5389].  However, ICE only defines procedures for UDP-based
     transport protocols.
