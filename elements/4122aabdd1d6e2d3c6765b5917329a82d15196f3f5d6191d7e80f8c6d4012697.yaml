        Tutorial: A time stamp can be used as evidence to prove that a
        data object existed (or that an event occurred) at or before a
        particular time. For example, a time stamp might be used to prove
        that a digital signature based on a private key was created while
        the corresponding public-key certificate was valid, i.e., before
        the certificate either expired or was revoked. Establishing this
        proof would enable the certificate to be used after its expiration
        or revocation, to verify a signature that was created earlier.
        This kind of proof is required as part of implementing PKI
        services, such as non-repudiation service, and long-term security
        services, such as audit.

  - 튜토리얼: 타임스탬프는 특정 시간이나 그 이전에 데이터 개체가 존재했는지(또는 이벤트가 발생했는지) 증명하는 증거로 사용될 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 타임스탬프는 개인 키를 기반으로 한 디지털 서명이 해당 공개 키 인증서가 유효한 동안, 즉 인증서가 만료되거나 취소되기 전에 생성되었음을 증명하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다. 이 증명을 설정하면 인증서가 만료되거나 취소된 후 이전에 생성된 서명을 확인하는 데 사용할 수 있습니다. 이러한 종류의 증명은 부인방지 서비스 등의 PKI 서비스와 감사 등의 장기 보안 서비스 구현의 일환으로 필요합니다.
