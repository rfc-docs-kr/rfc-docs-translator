     Preconfiguration does require some manually-maintained configuration
     information, but not excessively more so than what router
     administrators already maintain today. As an addition to the amount
     of information that must be typed in and maintained by a human,
     preconfiguration is just a line or two defining the range of the
     block of IP addresses to aggregate. In terms of gathering the
     information, if the advertising router is doing the aggregation, its
     administrator knows the information because the aggregation ranges
     are assigned to its domain.  If the receiving domain has been granted
     the authority to and task of performing aggregation, the information
     would be known as part of the agreement to delegate aggregation.
     Given that it is common practice that a network administrator learns
     from its neighbor which routes it should be willing to accept,
     preconfiguration of aggregation information does not introduce
     additional administrative overhead.
