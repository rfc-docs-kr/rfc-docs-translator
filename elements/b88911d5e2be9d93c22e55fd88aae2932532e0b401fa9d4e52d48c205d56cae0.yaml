        Since additional code points are added by amendments to the 10646
        standard from time to time, implementations MUST be prepared to
        encounter any code point from 0x00000001 to 0x7fffffff.  Byte
        sequences that do not correspond to the valid encoding of a code
        point into UTF-8 charset or are outside this range are prohibited.
