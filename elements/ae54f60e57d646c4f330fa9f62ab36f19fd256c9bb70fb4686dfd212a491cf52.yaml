     As described in Section 2.1, only a single EAP authentication method
     is allowed within an EAP conversation.  EAP methods may implement
     result indications.  After the authenticator sends a failure result
     indication to the peer, regardless of the response from the peer, it
     MUST subsequently send a Failure packet.  After the authenticator
     sends a success result indication to the peer and receives a success
     result indication from the peer, it MUST subsequently send a Success
     packet.
