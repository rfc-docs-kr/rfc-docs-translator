          The Designated Router is the endpoint of many adjacencies.  In
          order to optimize the flooding procedure on broadcast networks,
          the Designated Router multicasts its Link State Update Packets
          to the address AllSPFRouters, rather than sending separate
          packets over each adjacency.
