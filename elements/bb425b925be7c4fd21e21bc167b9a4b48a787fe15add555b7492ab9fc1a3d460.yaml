     If a suitable subnetting scheme can be designed and is supported by
     the equipment concerned, it is advisable to use the 24-bit block of
     private address space and make an addressing plan with a good growth
     path.  If subnetting is a problem, the 16-bit class C block, which
     consists of 255 contiguous class C network numbers, can be used.
