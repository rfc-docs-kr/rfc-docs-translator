     In IPSec transport mode, both AH and ESP have an integrity check
     covering the entire payload. When the payload is TCP or UDP, the
     TCP/UDP checksum is covered by the integrity check. When a NAT device
     modifies an address the checksum is no longer valid with respect to
     the new address. Normally, NAT also updates the checksum, but this is
     ineffective when AH and ESP are used.  Consequently, receivers will
     discard a packet either because it fails the IPSec integrity check
     (if the NAT device updates the checksum), or because the checksum is
     invalid (if the NAT device leaves the checksum unmodified).
