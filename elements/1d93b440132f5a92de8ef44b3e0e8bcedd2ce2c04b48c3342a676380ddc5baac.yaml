     There are limitations to using NAT. For example, requests and
     responses pertaining to a session must be routed via the same NAT
     router, as a NAT router maintains state information for sessions
     established through it. For this reason, it is often suggested that
     NAT routers be operated on a border router unique to a stub domain,
     where all IP packets are either originated from the domain or
     destined to the domain. However, such a configuration would turn a
     NAT router into a single point of failure.
