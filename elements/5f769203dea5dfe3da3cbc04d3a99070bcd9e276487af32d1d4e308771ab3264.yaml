          The IP source address should be set to the IP address of the
          sending interface.  Interfaces to unnumbered point-to-point
          networks have no associated IP address.  On these interfaces,
          the IP source should be set to any of the other IP addresses
          belonging to the router.  For this reason, there must be at
          least one IP address assigned to the router.[2] Note that, for
          most purposes, virtual links act precisely the same as
          unnumbered point-to-point networks.  However, each virtual link
          does have an IP interface address (discovered during the routing
          table build process) which is used as the IP source when sending
          packets over the virtual link.
