              DISCUSSION:
                   Failure to follow this recommendation causes the first
                   packet of every exchange to be lost.  Although higher-
                   layer protocols can generally cope with packet loss by
                   retransmission, packet loss does impact performance.
                   For example, loss of a TCP open request causes the
                   initial round-trip time estimate to be inflated.  UDP-
                   based applications such as the Domain Name System are
                   more seriously affected.
