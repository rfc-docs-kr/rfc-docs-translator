              The purpose of this RFC is to focus discussion on particular
              problems in the Internet and possible methods of solution.
              No proposed solutions this document are intended as
              standards for the Internet.  Rather, it is hoped that a
              general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution
              to such problems, leading eventually to the adoption of
              standards.
