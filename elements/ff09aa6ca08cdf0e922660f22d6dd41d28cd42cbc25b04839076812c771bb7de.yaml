          (2) Call the vertex just added to the tree vertex V.  Examine
              the LSA associated with vertex V.  This is a lookup in the
              Area A's link state database based on the Vertex ID.  If
              this is a router-LSA, and bit V of the router-LSA (see
              Section A.4.2) is set, set Area A's TransitCapability to
              TRUE.  In any case, each link described by the LSA gives the
              cost to an adjacent vertex.  For each described link, (say
              it joins vertex V to vertex W):
