     Application Server (AS) - A logical entity serving a specific Routing
     Key.  An example of an Application Server is a virtual switch element
     handling all call processing for a signalling relation, identified by
     an SS7 DPC/OPC.  Another example is a virtual database element,
     handling all HLR transactions for a particular SS7 SIO/DPC/OPC
     combination.  The AS contains a set of one or more unique Application
     Server Processes, of which one or more is normally actively
     processing traffic.  Note that there is a 1:1 relationship between an
     AS and a Routing Key.
