     EAP may be used on dedicated links, as well as switched circuits, and
     wired as well as wireless links.  To date, EAP has been implemented
     with hosts and routers that connect via switched circuits or dial-up
     lines using PPP [RFC1661].  It has also been implemented with
     switches and access points using IEEE 802 [IEEE-802].  EAP
     encapsulation on IEEE 802 wired media is described in [IEEE-802.1X],
     and encapsulation on IEEE wireless LANs in [IEEE-802.11i].
