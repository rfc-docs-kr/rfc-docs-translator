          In some Autonomous Systems, the majority of the link-state
          database may consist of AS-external-LSAs.  An OSPF AS-external-
          LSA is usually flooded throughout the entire AS.  However, OSPF
          allows certain areas to be configured as "stub areas".  AS-
          external-LSAs are not flooded into/throughout stub areas;
          routing to AS external destinations in these areas is based on a
          (per-area) default only.  This reduces the link-state database
          size, and therefore the memory requirements, for a stub area's
          internal routers.
