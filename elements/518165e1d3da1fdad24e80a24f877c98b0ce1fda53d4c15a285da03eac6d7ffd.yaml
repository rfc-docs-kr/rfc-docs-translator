          Router ID
              This is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies the router
              in the Autonomous System.  One algorithm for Router ID
              assignment is to choose the largest or smallest IP address
              assigned to the router.  If a router's OSPF Router ID is
              changed, the router's OSPF software should be restarted
              before the new Router ID takes effect. Before restarting in
              order to change its Router ID, the router should flush its
              self-originated LSAs from the routing domain (see Section
              14.1), or they will persist for up to MaxAge minutes.
