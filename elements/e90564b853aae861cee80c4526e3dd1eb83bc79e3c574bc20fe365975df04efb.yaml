     ICE requires an agent to demultiplex STUN and application-layer
     traffic, since they appear on the same port.  This demultiplexing is
     described in [RFC5245] and is done using the magic cookie and other
     fields of the message.  Stream-oriented transports introduce another
     wrinkle, since they require a way to frame the connection so that the
     application and STUN packets can be extracted in order to
     differentiate STUN packets from application-layer traffic.  For this
     reason, TCP media streams utilizing ICE use the basic framing
     provided in RFC 4571 [RFC4571], even if the application layer
     protocol is not RTP.
