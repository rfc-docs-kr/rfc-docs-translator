     It is recommended that MSPs advertise MX records for the handling of
     inbound mail (instead of relying entirely on A or AAAA records) and
     that those MX records be signed using DNSSEC [RFC4033].  This is
     mentioned here only for completeness, as the handling of inbound mail
     is out of scope for this document.
