     (Note 6) Since the Framed-IP-Address, Framed-IPv6-Prefix, and
     Framed-Interface-Id attributes are used for session identification,
     renumbering cannot be accomplished by including values of these
     attributes within a CoA-Request.  Instead, a CoA-Request including a
     Service-Type Attribute with a value of "Authorize Only" is sent; new
     values can be supplied in an Access-Accept sent in response to the
     ensuing Access-Request.  Note that renumbering will not be possible
     in all situations.  For example, in order to change an IP address,
     IPCP or IPv6CP re-negotiation could be required, which is not
     supported by all PPP implementations.
