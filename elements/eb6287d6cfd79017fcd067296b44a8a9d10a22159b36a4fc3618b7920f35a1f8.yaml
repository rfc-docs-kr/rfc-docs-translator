              DISCUSSION:
                   It is known that the window field in the TCP header is
                   too small for high-speed, long-delay paths.
                   Experimental TCP options have been defined to extend
                   the window size; see for example [TCP:11].  In
                   anticipation of the adoption of such an extension, TCP
                   implementors should treat windows as 32 bits.
