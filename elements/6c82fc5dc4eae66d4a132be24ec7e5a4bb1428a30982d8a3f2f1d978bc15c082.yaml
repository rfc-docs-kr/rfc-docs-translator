        In the following, the action specified in certain cases is to
        "silently discard" a received datagram.  This means that the
        datagram will be discarded without further processing and that the
        host will not send any ICMP error message (see Section 3.2.2) as a
        result.  However, for diagnosis of problems a host SHOULD provide
        the capability of logging the error (see Section 1.2.3), including
        the contents of the silently-discarded datagram, and SHOULD record
        the event in a statistics counter.
