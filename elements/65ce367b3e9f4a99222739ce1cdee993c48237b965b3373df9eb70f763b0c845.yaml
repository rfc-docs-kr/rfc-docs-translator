     This example provides an architecture that supports the full TWAMP
     standard.  The controller establishes the test session with the
     responder through the TWAMP-Control protocol.  After the session is
     established, the controller transmits test packets to the responder.
     The responder follows the Session-Reflector behavior of TWAMP as
     described in Section 4.2.
