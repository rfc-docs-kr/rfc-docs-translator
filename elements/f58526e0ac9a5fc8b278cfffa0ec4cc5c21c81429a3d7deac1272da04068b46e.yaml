          OSPF's Hello protocol uses Hello packets to discover and
          maintain neighbor relationships.  The Database Description and
          Link State Request packets are used in the forming of
          adjacencies.  OSPF's reliable update mechanism is implemented by
          the Link State Update and Link State Acknowledgment packets.
