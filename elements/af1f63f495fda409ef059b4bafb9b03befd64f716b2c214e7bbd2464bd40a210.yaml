     it has already tried to send the accounting records in its non-
     volatile memory before the reboot occurred.  Diameter servers MAY use
     the T flag as an aid when processing requests and detecting duplicate
     messages.  However, servers that do this MUST ensure that duplicates
     are found even when the first transmitted request arrives at the
     server after the retransmitted request.  It can be used only in cases
     where no answer has been received from the server for a request and
     the request is sent again, (e.g., due to a failover to an alternate
     peer, due to a recovered primary peer or due to a client re-sending a
     stored record from non-volatile memory such as after reboot of a
     client or agent).
