          A link-state algorithm has also been proposed for use as an ISO
          IS-IS routing protocol.  This protocol is described in [Ref2].
          The protocol includes methods for data and routing traffic
          reduction when operating over broadcast networks.  This is
          accomplished by election of a Designated Router for each
          broadcast network, which then originates an LSA for the network.
