        If the old TRD and the new TRD are themselves connected by other
        cooperative transit routing domains, then these intermediate
        domains may agree to forward traffic for XYZ correctly. For
        example, suppose that NorthSouthNet and NewCommercialNet are not
        directly connected, but that they are both directly connected to
        the BBNet backbone.  In this case, all three of NorthSouthNet,
        NewCommercialNet, and the BBNet backbone would need to maintain a
        special entry for XYZ corporation so that traffic to XYZ using the
        old address allocation would be forwarded via NewCommercialNet.
        However, other routing domains would not need to be aware of the
        new location for XYZ Corporation.
