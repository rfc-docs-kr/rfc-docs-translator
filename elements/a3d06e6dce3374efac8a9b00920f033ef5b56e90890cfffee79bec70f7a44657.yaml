     The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) standard [1,2,3] defines
     a family of compression algorithms for continuous-tone, still images.
     This still image compression standard can be applied to video by
     compressing each frame of video as an independent still image and
     transmitting them in series.  Video coded in this fashion is often
     called Motion-JPEG.
