     Merkle hash tree
         A tree of hashes whose base is formed by the hashes of the chunks
         of content, and its higher nodes are calculated by recursively
         computing the hash of the concatenation of the two child hashes
         (see Section 5.1).

  머클 해시 트리(Merkle hash tree) - 콘텐츠 덩어리의 해시로 기반이 형성되고 상위 노드가 두 하위 해시를 연결한 해시를 재귀적으로 계산하여 계산되는 해시 트리입니다(섹션 5.1 참조).
