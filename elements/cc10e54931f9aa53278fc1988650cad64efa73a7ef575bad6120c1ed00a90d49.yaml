           The Authenticator field in a Response packet (e.g.,
           Disconnect-ACK, Disconnect-NAK, CoA-ACK, or CoA-NAK) is called
           the Response Authenticator, and contains a one-way MD5 hash
           calculated over a stream of octets consisting of the Code,
           Identifier, Length, the Request Authenticator field from the
           packet being replied to, and the response attributes if any,
           followed by the shared secret.  The resulting 16-octet MD5 hash
           value is stored in the Authenticator field of the Response
           packet.
