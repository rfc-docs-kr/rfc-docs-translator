              After consideration of all the router interfaces, host links
              are added to the router-LSA by examining the list of
              attached hosts belonging to Area A.  A host route is
              represented as a Type 3 link (stub network) whose Link ID is
              the host's IP address, Link Data is the mask of all ones
              (0xffffffff), and cost the host's configured cost (see
              Section C.7).
