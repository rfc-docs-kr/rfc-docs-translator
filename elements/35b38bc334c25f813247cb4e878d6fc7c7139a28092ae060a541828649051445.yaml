              A cost is associated with the output side of each router
              interface.  This cost is configurable by the system
              administrator.  The lower the cost, the more likely the
              interface is to be used to forward data traffic.  Costs are
              also associated with the externally derived routing data
              (e.g., the BGP-learned routes).
