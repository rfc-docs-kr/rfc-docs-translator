     Description:
     This package defines signals to generate audio tones. This package
     does not specify parameter values. It is intended to be extendable.
     Generally, tones are defined as an individual signal with a
     parameter, ind, representing "interdigit" time delay, and a tone id
     to be used with playtones.  A tone id should be kept consistent with
     any tone generation for the same tone. MGs are expected to be
     provisioned with the characteristics of appropriate tones for the
     country in which the MG is located.
