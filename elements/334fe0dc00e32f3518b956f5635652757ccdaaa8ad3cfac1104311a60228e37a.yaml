     Errors that fall within the permanent failures category are used to
     inform the peer that the request failed and should not be attempted
     again.  Note that these errors SHOULD be used in answer messages
     whose 'E' bit is not set.  In error conditions where it is not
     possible or efficient to compose application-specific answer grammar,
     answer messages with the 'E' bit set and which comply to the grammar
     described in Section 7.2 MAY also be used for permanent errors.
