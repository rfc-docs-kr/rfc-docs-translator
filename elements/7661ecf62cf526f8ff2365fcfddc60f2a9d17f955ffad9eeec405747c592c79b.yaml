     The <lock> operation will demonstrate that NETCONF is intended for
     use by systems that have at least some trust of the administrator.
     As specified in this document, it is possible to lock portions of a
     configuration that a principal might not otherwise have access to.
     After all, the entire configuration is locked.  To mitigate this
     problem, there are two approaches.  It is possible to kill another
     NETCONF session programmatically from within NETCONF if one knows the
     session identifier of the offending session.  The other possible way
     to break a lock is to provide a function within the device's native
     user interface.  These two mechanisms suffer from a race condition
     that could be ameliorated by removing the offending user from an
     Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server.  However,
     such a solution is not useful in all deployment scenarios, such as
     those where SSH public/private key pairs are used.
