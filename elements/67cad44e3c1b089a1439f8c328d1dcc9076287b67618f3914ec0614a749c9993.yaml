     An offramp gateway SHOULD have a function that allows it to send a
     return notice to the originator Internet Fax device (defined in [4])
     when a transmission error occurs over the GSTN fax service and the
     facsimile is not delivered to the destination.  The return notice
     MUST be in Message Delivery Notification (MDN) format and delivered
     by the offramp gateway over the Internet e-mail transport service
     used by Internet Fax.  The MDN disposition-type MUST be set as
     "processed", and the disposition-modifier MUST be set as an "error".
