          A detailed description of the neighbor state changes follows.
          Each state change is invoked by an event (Section 10.2).  This
          event may produce different effects, depending on the current
          state of the neighbor.  For this reason, the state machine below
          is organized by current neighbor state and received event.  Each
          entry in the state machine describes the resulting new neighbor
          state and the required set of additional actions.
