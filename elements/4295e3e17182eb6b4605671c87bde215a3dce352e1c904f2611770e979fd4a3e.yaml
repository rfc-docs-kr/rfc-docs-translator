        With the second approach, an RSA-IP-Server could be any router
        (including a NAT router) that can be a tunnel end-point with
        RSA-IP-Clients.  It would detunnel end-to-end packets outbound
        from RSA-IP-Clients and forward to external hosts. On the
        return path, it would locate RSA-IP-Client tunnel, based on the
        destination address of the end-to-end packet and encapsulate the
        packet in a tunnel to forward to RSA-IP-Client.
