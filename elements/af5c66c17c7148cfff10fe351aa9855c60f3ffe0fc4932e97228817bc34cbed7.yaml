     2. At each step, a timer is set to wait for the next event, based
        either on the default timing rules given above or on explicit
        timing specified in one or more alternative event sequences. If
        the timer expires and a member of the candidate set of
        alternatives is fully satisfied, a timeout completion with full
        match is reported.  If the timer expires and part or none of any
        candidate alternative is satisfied, a timeout completion with
        partial match is reported.
