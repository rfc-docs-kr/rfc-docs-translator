     If the authenticator has not sent a result indication, and the peer
     is willing to continue the conversation, the peer waits for a Success
     or Failure packet once the method completes, and MUST NOT silently
     discard either of them.  In the event that neither a Success nor
     Failure packet is received, the peer SHOULD terminate the
     conversation to avoid lengthy timeouts in case the lost packet was an
     EAP Failure.
