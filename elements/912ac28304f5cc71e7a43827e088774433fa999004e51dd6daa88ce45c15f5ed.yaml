          Network
              In this memo, an IP network/subnet/supernet.  It is possible
              for one physical network to be assigned multiple IP
              network/subnet numbers.  We consider these to be separate
              networks.  Point-to-point physical networks are an exception
              - they are considered a single network no matter how many
              (if any at all) IP network/subnet numbers are assigned to
              them.
