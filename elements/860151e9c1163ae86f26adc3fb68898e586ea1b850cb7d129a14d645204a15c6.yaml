     XML subtree filtering is a mechanism that allows an application to
     select particular XML subtrees to include in the <rpc-reply> for a
     <get> or <get-config> operation.  A small set of filters for
     inclusion, simple content exact-match, and selection is provided,
     which allows some useful, but also very limited, selection
     mechanisms.  The server does not need to utilize any data-model-
     specific semantics during processing, allowing for simple and
     centralized implementation strategies.
