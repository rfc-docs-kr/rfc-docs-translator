     An ASP MAY dynamically deregister with an SGP as an ASP within an
     Application Server using the DEREG REQ message.  A Routing Context
     parameter in the DEREG REQ message specifies which Routing Keys to
     deregister.  An ASP SHOULD move to the ASP-INACTIVE state for an
     Application Server before attempting to deregister the Routing Key
     (i.e., deregister after receiving an ASP Inactive Ack).  Also, an ASP
     SHOULD deregister from all Application Servers of which it is a
     member before attempting to move to the ASP-Down state.
