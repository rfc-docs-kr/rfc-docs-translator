     o  MUAs SHOULD provide a prominent indication of the level of
        confidentiality associated with an account configuration that is
        appropriate for the user interface (for example, a "lock" icon or
        changed background color for a visual interface, or some sort of
        audible indication for an audio user interface), at appropriate
        times and/or locations, in order to inform the user of the
        confidentiality of the communications associated with that
        account.  For example, this might be done whenever (a) the user is
        prompted for authentication credentials, (b) the user is composing
        mail that will be sent to a particular submission server, (c) a
        list of accounts is displayed (particularly if the user can select
        from that list to read mail), or (d) the user is asking to view or
        update any configuration data that will be stored on a remote
        server.  If, however, an MUA provides such an indication, it
        MUST NOT indicate confidentiality for any connection that does not
        at least use TLS 1.1 with certificate verification and also meet
        the minimum confidentiality requirements associated with that
        account.
