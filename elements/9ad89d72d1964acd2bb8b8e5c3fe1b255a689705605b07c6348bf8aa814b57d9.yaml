     Redirect agents are useful in scenarios where the Diameter routing
     configuration needs to be centralized.  An example is a redirect
     agent that provides services to all members of a consortium, but does
     not wish to be burdened with relaying all messages between realms.
     This scenario is advantageous since it does not require that the
     consortium provide routing updates to its members when changes are
     made to a member's infrastructure.
