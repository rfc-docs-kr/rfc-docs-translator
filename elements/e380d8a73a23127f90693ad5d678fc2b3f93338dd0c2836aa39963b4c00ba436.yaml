                   A route cache entry may also include control
                   information used to choose an entry for replacement.
                   This might take the form of a "recently used" bit, a
                   use count, or a last-used timestamp, for example.  It
                   is recommended that it include the time of last
                   modification of the entry, for diagnostic purposes.
