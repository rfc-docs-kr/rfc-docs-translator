     A MG is pre-provisioned by a management mechanism outside the scope
     of this protocol with a Primary and (optionally) an ordered list of
     Secondary MGCs.  Upon a cold start of the MG, it will issue a
     ServiceChange command with a "Restart" method, on the Root
     Termination to its primary MGC.  If the MGC accepts the MG, it will
     send a Transaction Accept, with the ServiceChangeMgcId set to itself.
     If the MG receives an ServiceChangeMgcId not equal to the MGC it
     contacted, it sends a ServiceChange to the MGC specified in the
     ServiceChangeMgcId.  It continues this process until it gets a
     controlling MGC to accept its registration, or it fails to get a
     reply.  Upon failure to obtain a reply, either from the Primary MGC,
     or a designated successor, the MG tries its pre-provisioned Secondary
     MGCs, in order.  If the MG is unable to establish a control
     relationship with any MGC, it shall wait a random amount of time as
     described in section 9.2 and then start contacting its primary, and
     if necessary, its secondary MGCs again.
