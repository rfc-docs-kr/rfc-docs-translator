     CERs received from unknown peers MAY be silently discarded, or a CEA
     MAY be issued with the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_UNKNOWN_PEER.
     In both cases, the transport connection is closed.  If the local
     policy permits receiving CERs from unknown hosts, a successful CEA
     MAY be returned.  If a CER from an unknown peer is answered with a
     successful CEA, the lifetime of the peer entry is equal to the
     lifetime of the transport connection.  In case of a transport
     failure, all the pending transactions destined to the unknown peer
     can be discarded.
