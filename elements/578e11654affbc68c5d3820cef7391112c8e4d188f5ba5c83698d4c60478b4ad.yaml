     Where no proxy is present, the RPF check can only be performed by the
     NAS if it maintains its own a realm routing table.  If the NAS does
     not maintain a realm routing table (e.g., it selects forwarding
     proxies based on primary/secondary configuration and/or liveness
     checks), then an RPF check cannot be performed.
