        limit the size of packets forwarded to 552 octets, with a MAC
        header+trailer of 36 octets and the LLC+SNAP of 8 octets, the IP
        datagram (including the IP header) may be limited to 508 octets.
        This is less that the default IP MTU of 576 octets, and may cause
        significant performance problems due to excessive datagram
        fragmentation.  An implementation is not required to support an
        MTU of less than 576 octets, although it is suggest that the MTU
        be a user-configurable parameter to allow for it.
