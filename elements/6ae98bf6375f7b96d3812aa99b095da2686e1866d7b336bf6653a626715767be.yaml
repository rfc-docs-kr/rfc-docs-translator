      [5]It is instructive to see what happens when the Designated Router
      for the network crashes.  Call the Designated Router for the network
      RT1, and the Backup Designated Router RT2.  If Router RT1 crashes
      (or maybe its interface to the network dies), the other routers on
      the network will detect RT1's absence within RouterDeadInterval
      seconds.  All routers may not detect this at precisely the same
      time; the routers that detect RT1's absence before RT2 does will,
      for a time, select RT2 to be both Designated Router and Backup
      Designated Router.  When RT2 detects that RT1 is gone it will move
      itself to Designated Router.  At this time, the remaining router
      having highest Router Priority will be selected as Backup Designated
      Router.
