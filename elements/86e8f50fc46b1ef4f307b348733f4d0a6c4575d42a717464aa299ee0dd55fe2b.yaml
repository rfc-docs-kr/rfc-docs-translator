     o  The '*' (ASCII 42) wildcard character is allowed in the dNSName of
        the subjectAltName extension (and in common name, if used to store
        the host name), but only as the left-most (least significant) DNS
        label in that value.  This wildcard matches any left-most DNS
        label in the server name.  That is, the subject *.example.com
        matches the server names a.example.com and b.example.com, but does
        not match example.com or a.b.example.com.  Implementations MUST
        support wildcards in certificates as specified above, but MAY
        provide a configuration option to disable them.
