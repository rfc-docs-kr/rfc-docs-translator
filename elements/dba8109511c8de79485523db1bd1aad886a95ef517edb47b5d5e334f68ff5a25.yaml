        The string in the NAI that immediately follows the '@' character.
        NAI realm names are required to be unique and are piggybacked on
        the administration of the DNS namespace.  Diameter makes use of
        the realm, also loosely referred to as domain, to determine
        whether messages can be satisfied locally or whether they must be
        routed or redirected.  In RADIUS, realm names are not necessarily
        piggybacked on the DNS namespace but may be independent of it.
