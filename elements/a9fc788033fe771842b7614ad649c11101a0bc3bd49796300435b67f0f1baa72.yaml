          Vertex (node) ID
              A 32-bit number which together with the vertex type (router
              or network) uniquely identifies the vertex.  For router
              vertices the Vertex ID is the router's OSPF Router ID.  For
              network vertices, it is the IP address of the network's
              Designated Router.
