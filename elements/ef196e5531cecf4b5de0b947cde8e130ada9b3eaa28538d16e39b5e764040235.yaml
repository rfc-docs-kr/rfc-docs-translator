     Offered load:  Offered load is also sometimes called "offered traffic
        load".  It is a measure of the amount of traffic being presented
        to be carried across a network compared to the capacity of the
        network to carry it.  This term derives from queuing theory, and
        an offered load of 1 indicates that the network can carry, but
        only just manage to carry, all of the traffic presented to it.

  제공 로드: 제공 로드는 "제공 트래픽 로드"라고도 합니다. 이는 트래픽을 전달하는 네트워크 용량과 비교하여 네트워크를 통해 전달되는 트래픽 양을 측정한 것입니다. 이 용어는 큐잉 이론에서 파생되었으며, 제공된 로드 1은 네트워크가 제공되는 모든 트래픽을 전달할 수 있지만 전달하는 데만 관리할 수 있음을 나타냅니다.
