              DISCUSSION:
                   When the PUSH flag is not implemented on SEND calls,
                   i.e., when the application/TCP interface uses a pure
                   streaming model, responsibility for aggregating any
                   tiny data fragments to form reasonable sized segments
                   is partially borne by the application layer.
