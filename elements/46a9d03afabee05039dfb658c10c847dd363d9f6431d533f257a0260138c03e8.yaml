     Finally, given the in-network caching functionality of ICNs,
     efficiency and performance metrics of in-network caching have to be
     defined.  Such metrics will need to guide researchers and operators
     regarding the performance of in-network caching algorithms.  A first
     step on this direction has been made in [Psaras11].  The paper
     proposes a formula that approximates the proportion of time that a
     piece of content stays in a network cache.  The model takes as input
     the rate of requests for a given piece of content (the Content of
     Interest (CoI)) and the rate of requests for all other contents that
     go through the given network element (router) and move the CoI down
     in the (LRU) cache.  The formula takes also into account the size of
     the cache of this router.
