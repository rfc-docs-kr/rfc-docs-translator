      The above algorithm assumes that all masks are contiguous; this
      ensures that when two networks have the same address, one mask is
      more specific than the other. The algorithm also assumes that no
      network exists having an address equal to another network's
      broadcast address. Given these two assumptions, the above algorithm
      always produces unique Link State IDs. The above algorithm can also
      be reworded as follows:  When originating an AS-external-LSA, try to
      use the network number as the Link State ID.  If that produces a
      conflict, examine the two networks in conflict. One will be a subset
      of the other. For the less specific network, use the network number
      as the Link State ID and for the more specific use the network's
      broadcast address instead (i.e., flip all the "host" bits to 1).  If
      the most specific network was originated first, this will cause you
      to originate two LSAs at once.
