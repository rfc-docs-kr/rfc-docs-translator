              Data received in an ICMP Echo Request MUST be entirely
              included in the resulting Echo Reply.  However, if sending
              the Echo Reply requires intentional fragmentation that is
              not implemented, the datagram MUST be truncated to maximum
              transmission size (see Section 3.3.3) and sent.
