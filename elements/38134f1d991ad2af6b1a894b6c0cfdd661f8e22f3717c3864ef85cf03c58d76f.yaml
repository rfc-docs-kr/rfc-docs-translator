      Link State Request packets are OSPF packet type 3.  After exchanging
      Database Description packets with a neighboring router, a router may
      find that parts of its link-state database are out-of-date.  The
      Link State Request packet is used to request the pieces of the
      neighbor's database that are more up-to-date.  Multiple Link State
      Request packets may need to be used.
