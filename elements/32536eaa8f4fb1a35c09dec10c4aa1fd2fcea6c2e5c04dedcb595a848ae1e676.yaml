     o  Clarified Application Id usage.  Clarify the proper use of
        Application Id information, which can be found in multiple places
        within a Diameter message.  This includes correlating Application
        Ids found in the message headers and AVPs.  These changes also
        clearly specify the proper Application Id value to use for
        specific base protocol messages (ASR/ASA, STR/STA) as well as
        clarify the content and use of Vendor-Specific-Application-Id.
