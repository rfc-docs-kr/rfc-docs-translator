     The NAS responds to a CoA-Request sent by a Dynamic Authorization
     Client with a CoA-ACK if the NAS is able to successfully change the
     authorizations for the user session(s), or a CoA-NAK if the CoA-
     Request is unsuccessful.  A NAS MUST respond to a CoA-Request
     including a Service-Type Attribute with an unsupported value with a
     CoA-NAK; an Error-Cause Attribute with value "Unsupported Service"
     SHOULD be included.
