          Whenever a new instance of an LSA is originated, its LS sequence
          number is incremented, its LS age is set to 0, its LS checksum
          is calculated, and the LSA is added to the link state database
          and flooded out the appropriate interfaces.  See Section 13.2
          for details concerning the installation of the LSA into the link
          state database.  See Section 13.3 for details concerning the
          flooding of newly originated LSAs.
