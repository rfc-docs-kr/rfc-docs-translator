        (a)  valid_policy_tree:  A tree of certificate policies with their
             optional qualifiers; each of the leaves of the tree
             represents a valid policy at this stage in the certification
             path validation.  If valid policies exist at this stage in
             the certification path validation, the depth of the tree is
             equal to the number of certificates in the chain that have
             been processed.  If valid policies do not exist at this stage
             in the certification path validation, the tree is set to
             NULL.  Once the tree is set to NULL, policy processing
             ceases.
