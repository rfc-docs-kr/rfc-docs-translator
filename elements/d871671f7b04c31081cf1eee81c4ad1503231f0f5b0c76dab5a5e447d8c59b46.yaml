     The primary obstacle to using IPsec to secure other protocols is
     deployment.  The major use of IPsec at present is for VPN
     applications, especially for remote network access.  Without
     extremely tight coordination between security administrators and
     application developers, VPN usage is not well suited to providing
     security services for individual applications since it is difficult
     for such applications to determine what security services have in
     fact been provided.

  다른 프로토콜을 보호하기 위해 IPsec을 사용하는 데 있어 주요 장애물은 배포입니다. 현재 IPsec의 주요 용도는 VPN 애플리케이션, 특히 원격 네트워크 액세스입니다. 보안 관리자와 애플리케이션 개발자 간의 극도로 긴밀한 조정 없이 VPN 사용은 개별 애플리케이션에 보안 서비스를 제공하는 데 적합하지 않습니다. 해당 애플리케이션이 실제로 어떤 보안 서비스가 제공되었는지 판단하기 어렵기 때문입니다.
