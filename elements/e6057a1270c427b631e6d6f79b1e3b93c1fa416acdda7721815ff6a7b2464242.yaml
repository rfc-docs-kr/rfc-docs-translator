     EAP was developed for use with PPP [RFC1661] and was later adapted
     for use in wired IEEE 802 networks [IEEE-802] in [IEEE-802.1X].
     Subsequently, EAP has been proposed for use on wireless LAN networks
     and over the Internet.  In all these situations, it is possible for
     an attacker to gain access to links over which EAP packets are
     transmitted.  For example, attacks on telephone infrastructure are
     documented in [DECEPTION].
