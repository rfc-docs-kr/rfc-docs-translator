      (2) The intra-area routes are calculated by building the shortest-
          path tree for each attached area.  In particular, all routing
          table entries whose Destination Type is "area border router" are
          calculated in this step.  This step is described in two parts.
          At first the tree is constructed by only considering those links
          between routers and transit networks.  Then the stub networks
          are incorporated into the tree. During the area's shortest-path
          tree calculation, the area's TransitCapability is also
          calculated for later use in Step 4.
