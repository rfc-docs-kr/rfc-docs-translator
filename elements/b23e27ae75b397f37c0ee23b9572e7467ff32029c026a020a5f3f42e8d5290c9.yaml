     If a confirming commit is not issued, the device will revert its
     configuration to the state prior to the issuance of the confirmed
     commit.  To cancel a confirmed commit and revert changes without
     waiting for the confirm timeout to expire, the client can explicitly
     restore the configuration to its state before the confirmed commit
     was issued, by using the <cancel-commit> operation.
