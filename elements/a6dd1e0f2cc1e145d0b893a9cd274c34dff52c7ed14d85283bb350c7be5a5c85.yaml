     In order to preserve algorithm independence, EAP methods deriving
     keys SHOULD support (and document) the protected negotiation of the
     ciphersuite used to protect the EAP conversation between the peer and
     server.  This is distinct from the ciphersuite negotiated between the
     peer and authenticator, used to protect data.
