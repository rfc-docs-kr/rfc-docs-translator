     We can loosely divide security goals into those related to protecting
     communications (COMMUNICATION SECURITY, also known as COMSEC) and
     those relating to protecting systems (ADMINISTRATIVE SECURITY or
     SYSTEM SECURITY).  Since communications are carried out by systems
     and access to systems is through communications channels, these goals
     obviously interlock, but they can also be independently provided.

  보안 목표를 통신 보호(COMSEC라고도 알려진 통신 보안)와 관련된 목표와 시스템 보호(관리 보안 또는 시스템 보안)와 관련된 목표로 느슨하게 나눌 수 있습니다. 통신은 시스템에 의해 수행되고 시스템에 대한 액세스는 통신 채널을 통해 이루어지기 때문에 이러한 목표는 분명히 연동되지만 독립적으로 제공될 수도 있습니다.
