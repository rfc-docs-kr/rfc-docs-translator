     AAA protocols such as RADIUS/EAP [RFC3579] and Diameter EAP [DIAM-
     EAP] only support "pass-through authenticator" operation.  As noted
     in [RFC3579] Section 2.6.2, a RADIUS server responds to an Access-
     Request encapsulating an EAP-Request, Success, or Failure packet with
     an Access-Reject.  There is therefore no support for "pass-through
     peer" operation.
