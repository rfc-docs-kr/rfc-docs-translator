     The term "Mail Account" refers to a user's identity with an MSP, that
     user's authentication credentials, any user email that is stored by
     the MSP, and any other per-user configuration information maintained
     by the MSP (for example, instructions for filtering spam).  Most MUAs
     support the ability to access multiple Mail Accounts.
