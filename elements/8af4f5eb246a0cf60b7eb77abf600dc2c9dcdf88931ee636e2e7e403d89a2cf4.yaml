     Restart markers in the JPEG data denote a point where the decoder
     should reset its state.  As defined by JPEG, restart markers are the
     only type of marker that may appear embedded in the entropy-coded
     segment, and they may only appear on an MCU boundary.  A "restart
     interval" is defined to be a block of data containing a restart
     marker followed by some fixed number of MCUs.  An exception is made
     for the first restart interval in each frame, which omits the initial
     restart marker and just begins with the MCU data.  When these markers
     are used, each frame is composed of some fixed number of back-to-back
     restart intervals.
