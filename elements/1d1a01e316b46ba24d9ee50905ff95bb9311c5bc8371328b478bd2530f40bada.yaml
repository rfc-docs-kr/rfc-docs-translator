     Another problem with IPsec as a security solution for SMTP is the
     lack of a standard IPsec API.  In order to take advantage of IPsec,
     applications in general need to be able to instruct the IPsec
     implementation about their security policies and discover what
     protection has been applied to their connections.  Without a standard
     API this is very difficult to do portably.

  SMTP용 보안 솔루션으로서 IPsec의 또 다른 문제점은 표준 IPsec API가 없다는 것입니다. IPsec을 활용하려면 일반적으로 응용 프로그램이 보안 정책에 대해 IPsec 구현에 지시하고 해당 연결에 어떤 보호가 적용되었는지 검색할 수 있어야 합니다. 표준 API가 없으면 이식하기가 매우 어렵습니다.
