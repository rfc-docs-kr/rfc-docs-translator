        Also note that the possible requirement to transition addresses
        based on changes in topology imply that it is valuable to
        anticipate the future topology changes before finalizing a plan
        for address allocation. For example, in the case of a routing
        domain which is initially single-homed, but which is expecting to
        become multi-homed in the future, it may be advantageous to assign
        IP addresses based on the anticipated future topology.
