          Many acknowledgments may be grouped together into a single Link
          State Acknowledgment packet.  Such a packet is sent back out the
          interface which received the LSAs.  The packet can be sent in
          one of two ways: delayed and sent on an interval timer, or sent
          directly to a particular neighbor.  The particular
          acknowledgment strategy used depends on the circumstances
          surrounding the receipt of the LSA.
