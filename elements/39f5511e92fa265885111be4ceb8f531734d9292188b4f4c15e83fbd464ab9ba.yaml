          The inter-area routes are calculated by examining summary-LSAs.
          If the router has active attachments to multiple areas, only
          backbone summary-LSAs are examined.  Routers attached to a
          single area examine that area's summary-LSAs.  In either case,
          the summary-LSAs examined below are all part of a single area's
          link state database (call it Area A).
