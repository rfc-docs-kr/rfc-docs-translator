     It is possible for the peer and EAP server to mutually authenticate
     and derive keys.  In order to provide keying material for use in a
     subsequently negotiated ciphersuite, an EAP method supporting key
     derivation MUST export a Master Session Key (MSK) of at least 64
     octets, and an Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) of at least 64
     octets.  EAP Methods deriving keys MUST provide for mutual
     authentication between the EAP peer and the EAP Server.
