     $ security architecture
        (I) A plan and set of principles that describe (a) the security
        services that a system is required to provide to meet the needs of
        its users, (b) the system components required to implement the
        services, and (c) the performance levels required in the
        components to deal with the threat environment (e.g., [R2179]).
        (See: defense in depth, IATF, OSIRM Security Architecture,
        security controls, Tutorial under "security policy".)
