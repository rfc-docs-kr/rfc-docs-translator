     For clarity and brevity, the structure definitions are only valid for
     32-bit big-endian (most significant octet first) architectures. Bit
     fields are assumed to be packed tightly in big-endian bit order, with
     no additional padding. Modifications would be required to construct a
     portable implementation.
