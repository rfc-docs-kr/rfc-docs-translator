              If there is at least one intervening router in the current
              shortest path between the destination and the root, the
              destination simply inherits the set of next hops from the
              parent.  Otherwise, there are two cases.  In the first case,
              the parent vertex is the root (the calculating router
              itself).  This means that the destination is either a
              directly connected network or directly connected router.
              The outgoing interface in this case is simply the OSPF
              interface connecting to the destination network/router. If
              the destination is a router which connects to the
              calculating router via a Point-to-MultiPoint network, the
              destination's next hop IP address(es) can be determined by
              examining the destination's router-LSA: each link pointing
              back to the calculating router and having a Link Data field
              belonging to the Point-to-MultiPoint network provides an IP
              address of the next hop router. If the destination is a
              directly connected network, or a router which connects to
              the calculating router via a point-to-point interface, no
              next hop IP address is required. If the destination is a
              router connected to the calculating router via a virtual
              link, the setting of the next hop should be deferred until
              the calculation in Section 16.3.
