        o  Time is limited.  If DNAv4 is to be effective in enabling low
           latency handoffs, it needs to complete in less than 10 ms.
           This implies that any heuristic used to eliminate candidate
           configurations needs to take at most a few milliseconds to
           compute.  This does not leave much room for heuristics based on
           observation of link-layer or Internet-layer traffic.
