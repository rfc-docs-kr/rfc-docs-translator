     Prior to the original deployment of CIDR, common practice was to
     propagate routes learned via exterior routing protocols (i.e., EGP or
     BGP) through a site's interior routing protocol (typically, OSPF,
     IS-IS, or RIP).  This was done to ensure that consistent and correct
     exit points were chosen for traffic to be sent to a destination
     learned through those protocols.  Four evolutionary effects -- the
     advent of CIDR, explosive growth of global routing state, widespread
     adoption of BGP4, and a requirement to propagate full path
     information -- have combined to deprecate that practice.  To ensure
     proper path propagation and prevent inter-AS routing inconsistency
     (BGP4's loop detection/prevention mechanism requires full path
     propagation), transit networks must use internal BGP (iBGP) for
     carrying routes learned from other providers both within and through
     their networks.
