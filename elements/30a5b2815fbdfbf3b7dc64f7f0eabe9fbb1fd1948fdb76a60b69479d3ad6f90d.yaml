     In order to automatically adapt to network load, this document
     specifies exponentially increasing timers.  If the initial timer is
     set to 200 milliseconds, the loss of a fifth retransmission will be
     detected after about 6 seconds.  This is probably an acceptable
     waiting delay to detect a failover.   The repetitions should
     continue after that delay not only in order to perhaps overcome a
     transient connectivity problem, but also in order to allow some more
     time for the execution of a failover - waiting a total delay of 30
     seconds is probably acceptable.
