     o  A received command that is missing AVPs that are defined as
        required in the commands CCF; examples are AVPs indicated as
        {AVP}.  The receiver issues an answer with the Result-Code set to
        DIAMETER_MISSING_AVP and creates an AVP with the AVP Code and
        other fields set as expected in the missing AVP.  The created AVP
        is then added to the Failed-AVP AVP.
