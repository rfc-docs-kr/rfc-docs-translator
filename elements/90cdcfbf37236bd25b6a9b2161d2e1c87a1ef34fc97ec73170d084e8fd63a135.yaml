     An example of an experimental facility that supports CCN is the Open
     Network Lab [ONL] that currently comprises 18 extensible gigabit
     routers and over a 100 computers representing clients and is freely
     available to the public for running CCN experiments.  Nodes in ONL
     are preloaded with CCNx software.  ONL provides a graphical user
     interface for easy configuration and testbed setup as per the
     experiment requirements, and also serves as a control mechanism,
     allowing access to various control variables and traffic counters.
