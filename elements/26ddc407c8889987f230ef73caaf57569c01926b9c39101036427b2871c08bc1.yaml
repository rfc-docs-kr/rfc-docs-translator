     The default server side state machine requires the reception of
     accounting records in any order and at any time, and it does not
     place any standards requirement on the processing of these records.
     Implementations of Diameter may perform checking, ordering,
     correlation, fraud detection, and other tasks based on these records.
     AVPs may need to be inspected as a part of these tasks.  The tasks
     can happen either immediately after record reception or in a post-
     processing phase.  However, as these tasks are typically application
     or even policy dependent, they are not standardized by the Diameter
     specifications.  Applications MAY define requirements on when to
     accept accounting records based on the used value of Accounting-
     Realtime-Required AVP, credit-limit checks, and so on.
