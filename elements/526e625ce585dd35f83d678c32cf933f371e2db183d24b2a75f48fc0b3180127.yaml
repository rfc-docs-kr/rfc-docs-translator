     In IEEE 802.11, a "link down" indication is an unreliable indication
     of link failure, since wireless signal strength can come and go and
     may be influenced by radio frequency interference generated by an
     attacker.  To avoid unnecessary resets, it is advisable to damp these
     indications, rather than passing them directly to the EAP.  Since EAP
     supports retransmission, it is robust against transient connectivity
     losses.
