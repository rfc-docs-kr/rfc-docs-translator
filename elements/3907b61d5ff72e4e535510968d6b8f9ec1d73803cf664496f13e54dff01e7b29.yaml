          Broadcast networks
              Networks supporting many (more than two) attached routers,
              together with the capability to address a single physical
              message to all of the attached routers (broadcast).
              Neighboring routers are discovered dynamically on these nets
              using OSPF's Hello Protocol.  The Hello Protocol itself
              takes advantage of the broadcast capability.  The OSPF
              protocol makes further use of multicast capabilities, if
              they exist.  Each pair of routers on a broadcast network is
              assumed to be able to communicate directly. An ethernet is
              an example of a broadcast network.
