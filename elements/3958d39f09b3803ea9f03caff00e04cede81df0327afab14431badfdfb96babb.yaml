     Taking a more systematic approach, and with the purpose of modeling
     the traffic load, we can resort to measurement studies that
     investigate the composition of Internet traffic, such as [Labovitz10]
     and [Maier09].  In [Labovitz10], a large-scale measurement study was
     performed, with the purpose of studying the traffic crossing inter-
     domain links.  The results indicate the dominance of Web traffic,
     amounting to 52% over all measured traffic.  However, Deep Packet
     Inspection (DPI) techniques reveal that 25-40% of all HTTP traffic
     actually carries video traffic.  Results from DPI techniques also
     reveal the difficulty in correctly identifying the application type
     in the case of P2P traffic: mapping observed port numbers to well-
     known applications shows P2P traffic constituting only 0.85% of
     overall traffic, while DPI raises this percentage to 18.32%
     [Labovitz10].  Relevant studies on a large ISP show that the
     percentage of P2P traffic ranges from 17% to 19% of overall traffic
     [Maier09].  Table 1 provides an overview of these figures.  The
     "other" traffic type denotes traffic that cannot be classified in any
     of the first three application categories, and it consists of
     unclassified traffic and traffic heavily fragmented into several
     applications (e.g., 0.17% DNS traffic).
