     It is strongly recommended that routers which connect enterprises to
     external networks are set up with appropriate packet and routing
     filters at both ends of the link in order to prevent packet and
     routing information leakage.  An enterprise should also filter any
     private networks from inbound routing information in order to protect
     itself from ambiguous routing situations which can occur if routes to
     the private address space point outside the enterprise.
