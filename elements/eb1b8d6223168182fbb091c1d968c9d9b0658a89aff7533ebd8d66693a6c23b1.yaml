     1. UDP sessions are inherently unsafe. Responses to a datagram
        could come from an address different from the target address
        used by sender ([Ref 4]). As a result, an incoming UDP packet
        might match the outbound session of a traditional NAT router
        only in part (the destination address and UDP port number of
        the packet match, but the source address and port number may
        not). In such a case, there is a potential security compromise
        for the NAT device in permitting inbound packets with partial
        match. This UDP security issue is also inherent to firewalls.
