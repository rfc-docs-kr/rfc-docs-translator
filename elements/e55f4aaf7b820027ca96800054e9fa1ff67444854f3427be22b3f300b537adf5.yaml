          ExternalRoutingCapability
              Entire OSPF areas can be configured as "stubs" (see Section
              3.6).  AS-external-LSAs will not be flooded into stub areas.
              This capability is represented by the E-bit in the OSPF
              Options field (see Section A.2).  In order to ensure
              consistent configuration of stub areas, all routers
              interfacing to such an area must have the E-bit clear in
              their Hello packets (see Sections 9.5 and 10.5).
