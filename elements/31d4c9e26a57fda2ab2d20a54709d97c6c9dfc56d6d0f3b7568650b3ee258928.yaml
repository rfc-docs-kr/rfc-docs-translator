     A lock should be acquired to prevent simultaneous updates from
     multiple sources.  If multiple sources are affecting the device, the
     application is hampered in both testing of its change to the
     configuration and in recovery if the update fails.  Acquiring a
     short-lived lock is a simple defense to prevent other parties from
     introducing unrelated changes.
