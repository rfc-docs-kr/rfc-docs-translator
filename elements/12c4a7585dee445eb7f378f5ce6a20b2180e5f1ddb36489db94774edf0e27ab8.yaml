     Implementation Note: Because the Success and Failure packets are not
     acknowledged, they are not retransmitted by the authenticator, and
     may be potentially lost.  A peer MUST allow for this circumstance as
     described in this note.  See also Section 3.4 for guidance on the
     processing of lower layer success and failure indications.
