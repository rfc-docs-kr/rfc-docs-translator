     Sample code is also provided, in Section 8.3 below, to perform HMAC
     based on any of the SHA algorithms described herein.  The sample code
     found in [RFC2104] was written in terms of a specified text size.
     Since SHA is defined in terms of an arbitrary number of bits, the
     sample HMAC code has been written to allow the text input to HMAC to
     have an arbitrary number of octets and bits.  A fixed-length
     interface is also provided.

  아래 섹션 8.3에는 여기에 설명된 SHA 알고리즘을 기반으로 HMAC를 수행하기 위한 샘플 코드도 제공됩니다. [RFC2104]에 있는 샘플 코드는 지정된 텍스트 크기로 작성되었습니다. SHA는 임의의 비트 수로 정의되므로 샘플 HMAC 코드는 HMAC에 대한 텍스트 입력이 임의의 수의 옥텟 및 비트를 가질 수 있도록 작성되었습니다. 고정 길이 인터페이스도 제공됩니다.
