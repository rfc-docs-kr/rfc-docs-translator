        *  Location:  Disc resident.  More precisely it is on disc when
                      asleep and called in core when awakened by a
                      program.
        *  Initiation:  It is initiated through 'WAKE' service calls
                        issued either by a user process or by the Handler.
        *  Main functions: * Establishes/deletes outgoing connections upon
                             users' requests.  For so doing it sends
                             control messages (see 2.4.2) to remote
                             HOST[s] in order to get links
                             established/released; it then notifies back
                             the users.
                           * Insures the processing of incoming control
                             messages (transmitted over control links),
                             e.g., for contributing to
                             establishments/deletions of connections
                             (those requested by remote HOSTS).
