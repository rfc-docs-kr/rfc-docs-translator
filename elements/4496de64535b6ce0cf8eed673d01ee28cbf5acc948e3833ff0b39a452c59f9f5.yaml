        The AVP Code, combined with the Vendor-Id field, identifies the
        attribute uniquely.  AVP numbers 1 through 255 are reserved for
        reuse of RADIUS attributes, without setting the Vendor-Id field.
        AVP numbers 256 and above are used for Diameter, which are
        allocated by IANA (see Section 11.1.1).
