     When implemented within PPP, EAP does not select a specific
     authentication mechanism at the PPP Link Control Phase, but rather
     postpones this until the Authentication Phase.  This allows the
     authenticator to request more information before determining the
     specific authentication mechanism.  This also permits the use of a
     "backend" server which actually implements the various mechanisms
     while the PPP authenticator merely passes through the authentication
     exchange.  The PPP Link Establishment and Authentication phases, and
     the Authentication Protocol Configuration Option, are defined in The
     Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661].
