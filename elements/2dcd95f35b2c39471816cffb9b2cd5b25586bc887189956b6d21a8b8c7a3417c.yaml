     A forwarding server may either perform its forwarding function in a
     pass through manner, where it sends retransmissions on as soon as it
     gets them, or it may take responsibility for retransmissions, for
     example in cases where the network link between forwarding and remote
     server has very different characteristics than the link between NAS
     and forwarding server.
