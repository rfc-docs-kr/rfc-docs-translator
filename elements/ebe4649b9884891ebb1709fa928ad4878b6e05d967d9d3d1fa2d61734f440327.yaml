     A Job object is contained by exactly one Printer; however, the
     identical Document data associated with a Job could be sent to either
     the same or a different Printer.  In this case, a second Job object
     would be created that would be almost identical to the first Job;
     however, it would have new (different) Job object identifiers (see
     Section 3.4).

  Job 개체는 정확히 하나의 프린터에 포함됩니다. 그러나 작업과 관련된 동일한 문서 데이터는 동일하거나 다른 프린터로 전송될 수 있습니다. 이 경우 첫 번째 Job과 거의 동일한 두 번째 Job 객체가 생성됩니다. 그러나 새로운(다른) Job 개체 식별자를 갖게 됩니다(섹션 3.4 참조).
