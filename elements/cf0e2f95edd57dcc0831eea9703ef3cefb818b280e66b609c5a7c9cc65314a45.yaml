         B.  If the PFX PDU is to be authenticated with HMAC, then an HMAC
             with SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224,
             or SHA-512/256 is computed on the contents of the Data in T
             (i.e., excluding the OCTET STRING tag and length bytes).
             This is exactly what would be initially digested in step 5A
             if public-key authentication were being used.
