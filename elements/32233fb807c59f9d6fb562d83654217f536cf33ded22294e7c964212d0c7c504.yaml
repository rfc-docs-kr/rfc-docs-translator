           A host IP layer implementation MAY have a configuration flag
           "All-Subnets-MTU", indicating that the MTU of the connected
           network is to be used for destinations on different subnets
           within the same network, but not for other networks.  Thus,
           this flag causes the network class mask, rather than the subnet
           address mask, to be used to choose an EMTU_S.  For a multihomed
           host, an "All-Subnets-MTU" flag is needed for each network
           interface.
