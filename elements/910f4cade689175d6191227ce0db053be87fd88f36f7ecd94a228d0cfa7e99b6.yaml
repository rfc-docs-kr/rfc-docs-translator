     When the proxy forwards a Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request, it MAY
     add a Proxy-State Attribute, but it MUST NOT add more than one.  If a
     Proxy-State Attribute is added to a packet when forwarding the
     packet, the Proxy-State Attribute MUST be added after any existing
     Proxy-State attributes.  The forwarding proxy MUST NOT change the
     order of any attributes of the same type, including Proxy-State.
     Other attributes can be placed before, after, or even between the
     Proxy-State attributes.
