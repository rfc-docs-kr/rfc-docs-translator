     A translation agent is a device that provides translation between two
     protocols (e.g., RADIUS<->Diameter, TACACS+<->Diameter).  Translation
     agents are likely to be used as aggregation servers to communicate
     with a Diameter infrastructure, while allowing for the embedded
     systems to be migrated at a slower pace.
