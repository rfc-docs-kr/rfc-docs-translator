     Tunneling EAP within another protocol enables an attack by a rogue
     EAP authenticator tunneling EAP to a legitimate server.  Where the
     tunneling protocol is used for key establishment but does not require
     peer authentication, an attacker convincing a legitimate peer to
     connect to it will be able to tunnel EAP packets to a legitimate
     server, successfully authenticating and obtaining the key.  This
     allows the attacker to successfully establish itself as a man-in-
     the-middle, gaining access to the network, as well as the ability to
     decrypt data traffic between the legitimate peer and server.
