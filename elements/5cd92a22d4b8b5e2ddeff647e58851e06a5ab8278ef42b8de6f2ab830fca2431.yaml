     Note that, as described in Section 4, once a non-null cipher suite
     has been activated, the effective maximum fragment length depends on
     the cipher suite and compression method, as well as on the negotiated
     max_fragment_length.  This must be taken into account when sizing
     buffers and checking for buffer overflow.

  섹션 4에 설명된 대로 Null이 아닌 암호 그룹이 활성화되면 효과적인 최대 조각 길이는 암호 그룹과 압축 방법은 물론 협상된 max_fragment_length에 따라 달라집니다. 버퍼 크기를 조정하고 버퍼 오버플로를 확인할 때 이 점을 고려해야 합니다.
