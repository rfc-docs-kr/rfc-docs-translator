     Anytime after the ASP has received an ASP Up Ack message from the SGP
     or IPSP, the ASP MAY send an ASP Active message to the SGP,
     indicating that the ASP is ready to start processing traffic.  This
     action MAY be initiated at the ASP by an M-ASP_ACTIVE request
     primitive from Layer Management or MAY be initiated automatically by
     an M3UA management function.  In the case where an ASP wishes to
     process the traffic for more than one Application Server across a
     common SCTP association, the ASP Active message(s) SHOULD contain a
     list of one or more Routing Contexts to indicate for which
     Application Servers the ASP Active message applies.  It is not
     necessary for the ASP to include all Routing Contexts of interest in
     a single ASP Active message, thus requesting to become active in all
     Routing Contexts at the same time.  Multiple ASP Active messages MAY
     be used to activate within the Application Servers independently, or
     in sets.
