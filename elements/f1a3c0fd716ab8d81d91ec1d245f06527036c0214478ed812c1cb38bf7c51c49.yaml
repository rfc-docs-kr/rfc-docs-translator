     Note that IPsec tunnel mode ESP is permissible so long as the
     embedded packet contents are unaffected by the outer IP header
     translation. Although this technique does not work in traditional NAT
     deployments (i.e., where hosts are unaware that NATs are present),
     the technique is applicable to Realm-Specific IP as described in
     Section 5.0.
