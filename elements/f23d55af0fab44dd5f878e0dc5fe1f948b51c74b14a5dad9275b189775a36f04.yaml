     Should it be the case the class-A network numbers are subdivided into
     blocks allocated to transit network providers, it will be similarly
     necessary to relax the restriction on how IN-ADDR.ARPA naming works
     for them. As an example, take a provider is allocated the 19-bit
     portion of address space which matches 10.8.0.0 with mask
     255.248.0.0. This represents all addresses which begin with the
     prefixes 10.8, 10.9, 10.10, 10.11, 10.12, 10.13, 10.14, an 10.15 and
     requires the following IN-ADDR.ARPA delegations:
