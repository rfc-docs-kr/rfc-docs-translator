     The development and validation of key derivation algorithms is
     difficult, and as a result, EAP methods SHOULD re-use well
     established and analyzed mechanisms for key derivation (such as those
     specified in IKE [RFC2409] or TLS [RFC2246]), rather than inventing
     new ones. EAP methods SHOULD also utilize well established and
     analyzed mechanisms for MSK and EMSK derivation.  Further details on
     EAP Key Derivation are provided within [KEYFRAME].
