     All NETCONF messages MUST be well-formed XML, encoded in UTF-8
     [RFC3629].  If a peer receives an <rpc> message that is not well-
     formed XML or not encoded in UTF-8, it SHOULD reply with a
     "malformed-message" error.  If a reply cannot be sent for any reason,
     the server MUST terminate the session.
