     This state machine is closely coupled with the state machine
     described in [RFC3539], which is used to open, close, failover,
     probe, and reopen transport connections.  In particular, note that
     [RFC3539] requires the use of watchdog messages to probe connections.
     For Diameter, DWR and DWA messages are to be used.
