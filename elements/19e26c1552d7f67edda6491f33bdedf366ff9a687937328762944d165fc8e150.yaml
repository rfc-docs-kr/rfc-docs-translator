      Each LSA describes a piece of the OSPF routing domain.  Every router
      originates a router-LSA.  In addition, whenever the router is
      elected Designated Router, it originates a network-LSA.  Other types
      of LSAs may also be originated (see Section 12.4).  All LSAs are
      then flooded throughout the OSPF routing domain.  The flooding
      algorithm is reliable, ensuring that all routers have the same
      collection of LSAs.  (See Section 13 for more information concerning
      the flooding algorithm).  This collection of LSAs is called the
      link-state database.
