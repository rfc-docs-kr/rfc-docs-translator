     When an agent wants to send a TCP-based connectivity check, it first
     opens a TCP connection, if none yet exists, for the 5-tuple defined
     by the candidate pair for which the check is to be sent.  This
     connection is opened from the local candidate of the pair to the
     remote candidate of the pair.  If the local candidate is tcp-active,
     the agent MUST open a connection from the interface associated with
     that local candidate.  This connection SHOULD be opened from an
     unallocated port.  For host candidates, this is readily done by
     connecting from the local candidate's interface.  For relayed, NAT-
     assisted, and UDP-tunneled candidates, the agent may need to use
     additional procedures specific to the protocol.
