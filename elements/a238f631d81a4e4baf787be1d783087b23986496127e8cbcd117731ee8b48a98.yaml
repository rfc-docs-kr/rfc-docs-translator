     The means by which support for HTTP/2 is determined is different for
     "http" and "https" URIs.  Discovery for "https" URIs is described in
     Section 3.2.  HTTP/2 support for "http" URIs can only be discovered
     by out-of-band means and requires prior knowledge of the support as
     described in Section 3.3.
