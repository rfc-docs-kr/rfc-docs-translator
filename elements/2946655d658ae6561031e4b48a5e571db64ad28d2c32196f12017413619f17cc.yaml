          The Hello Protocol works differently on broadcast networks, NBMA
          networks and Point-to-MultiPoint networks.  On broadcast
          networks, each router advertises itself by periodically
          multicasting Hello Packets.  This allows neighbors to be
          discovered dynamically.  These Hello Packets contain the
          router's view of the Designated Router's identity, and the list
          of routers whose Hello Packets have been seen recently.
