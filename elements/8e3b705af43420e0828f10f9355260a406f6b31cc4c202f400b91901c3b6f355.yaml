          OSPF allows sets of networks to be grouped together.  Such a
          grouping is called an area.  The topology of an area is hidden
          from the rest of the Autonomous System.  This information hiding
          enables a significant reduction in routing traffic.  Also,
          routing within the area is determined only by the area's own
          topology, lending the area protection from bad routing data.  An
          area is a generalization of an IP subnetted network.
