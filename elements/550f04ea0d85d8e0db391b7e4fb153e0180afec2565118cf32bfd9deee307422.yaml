              The interface is to a broadcast or NBMA network on which
              another router has been selected to be the Designated
              Router.  In this state, the router itself has not been
              selected Backup Designated Router either.  The router forms
              adjacencies to both the Designated Router and the Backup
              Designated Router (if they exist).
