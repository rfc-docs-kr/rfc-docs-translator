           We designate the largest datagram size that can be reassembled
           by EMTU_R ("Effective MTU to receive"); this is sometimes
           called the "reassembly buffer size".  EMTU_R MUST be greater
           than or equal to 576, SHOULD be either configurable or
           indefinite, and SHOULD be greater than or equal to the MTU of
           the connected network(s).
