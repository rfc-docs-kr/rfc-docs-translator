  BB&N is prepared to convert 6, 7, 8, or 9 bit character codes into 8-bit
  ASCII for transmission and convert again upon assembly at the destination
  IMP.  BB&N plans a one for one conversion scheme with tables unique to the
  HOST.  I suggested that places with 6-bit codes may also want case shifting.
  Bob said this may result in overflow if too many case shifts are necessary.
  I suggested that this is rare and we could probably live with an overflow
  indication instead of a guarantee.
