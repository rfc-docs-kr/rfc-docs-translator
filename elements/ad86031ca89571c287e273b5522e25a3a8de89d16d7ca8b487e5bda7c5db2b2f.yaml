        Version 2.0 incorporated major editorial changes in terms of the
        document structure and introduced the RSAES-OAEP encryption
        scheme.  This version continued to support the encryption and
        signature processes in version 1.5, although the hash algorithm
        MD4 was no longer allowed due to cryptanalytic advances in the
        intervening years.  Version 2.0 was republished as [RFC2437]
        (which was later obsoleted by [RFC3447]).

  - 버전 2.0에서는 문서 구조 측면에서 주요 편집 변경 사항을 통합하고 RSAES-OAEP 암호화 체계를 도입했습니다. 이 버전은 버전 1.5의 암호화 및 서명 프로세스를 계속 지원했지만, 그 사이에 암호화 분석의 발전으로 인해 해시 알고리즘 MD4가 더 이상 허용되지 않았습니다. 버전 2.0은 [RFC2437]로 다시 출판되었습니다(나중에 [RFC3447]에 의해 폐기됨).
