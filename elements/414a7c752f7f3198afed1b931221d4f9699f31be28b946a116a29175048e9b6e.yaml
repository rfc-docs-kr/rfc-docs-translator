     Signals are defined in packages.  Signals shall be named with a
     Package name (in which the signal is defined) and a SignalID.  No
     wildcard shall be used in the SignalID.  Signals that occur in a
     SignalsDescriptor have an optional StreamID parameter (default is 0,
     to indicate that the signal is not related to a particular media
     stream), an optional signal type (see below), an optional duration
     and possibly parameters defined in the package that defines the
     signal.  This allows a single signal to have some variation in
     meaning, obviating the need to create large numbers of individual
     signals.
