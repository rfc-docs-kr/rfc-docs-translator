     Properties not included in the base protocol are defined in Packages.
     These properties are referred to by a name consisting of the
     PackageName and a PropertyId.  Most properties have default values
     described in the Package description. Properties may be read- only or
     read/write.  The possible values of a property may be audited, as can
     their current values.  For properties that are read/write, the MGC
     can set their values.  A property may be declared as "Global" which
     has a single value shared by all terminations realizing the package.
     Related properties are grouped into descriptors for convenience.
