     Restart markers indicate a point in the JPEG stream at which the
     Huffman decoder and DC predictors are reset, allowing partial
     decoding starting at that point.  To fully take advantage of this,
     however, a decoder must know which MCUs of a frame a particular
     restart interval encodes.  While the original JPEG specification does
     provide a small sequence number field in the restart markers for this
     purpose, it is not large enough to properly cope with the loss of an
     entire packet's worth of data at a typical network MTU size.  The
     RTP/JPEG Restart Marker header contains the additional information
     needed to accomplish this.
