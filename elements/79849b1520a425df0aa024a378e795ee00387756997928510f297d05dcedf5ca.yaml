          The link-state database for the backbone is shown in Figure 8.
          The set of routers pictured are the backbone routers.  Router
          RT11 is a backbone router because it belongs to two areas.  In
          order to make the backbone connected, a virtual link has been
          configured between Routers R10 and R11.
