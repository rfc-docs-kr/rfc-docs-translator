     Note that a basic assumption of this plan is that those organizations
     which need to import "supernet" information into their routing
     systems must run IGPs (such as OSPF [1]) which support classless
     routes. Systems running older IGPs may still advertise and receive
     "supernet" information, but they will not be able to propagate such
     information through their routing domains.
