                        (where >> represents the pointer).  If (A) is
                        sent, the datagram received at D will contain the
                        option: {G1, G2, ... Gn >>}, with S and D as the
                        IP source and destination addresses.  If (B) were
                        sent, the datagram received at D would again
                        contain S and D as the same IP source and
                        destination addresses, but the option would be:
                        {S, G1, ...Gn >>}; i.e., the originating host
                        would be the first hop in the route.
