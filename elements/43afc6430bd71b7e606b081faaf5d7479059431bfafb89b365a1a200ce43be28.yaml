        a) If the event in the queue is in the events listed in the new
           EventsDescriptor, the MG acts on the event and removes the
           event from the EventBuffer.  The time stamp of the Notify shall
           be the time the event was actually detected.  The MG then waits
           for a new EventsDescriptor. While waiting for a new
           EventsDescriptor, any events detected that appear in the
           EventsBufferDescriptor will be placed in the EventBuffer.  When
           a new EventsDescriptor is received, the event processing will
           repeat from step 1.
