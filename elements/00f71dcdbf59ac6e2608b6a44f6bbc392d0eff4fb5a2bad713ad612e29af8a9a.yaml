     The AH header [RFC2402] affords data origin authentication,
     connectionless integrity and optional anti-replay protection of
     messages passed between the MG and the MGC. The ESP header [RFC2406]
     provides confidentiality of messages, if desired. For instance, the
     ESP encryption service should be requested if the session
     descriptions are used to carry session keys, as defined in SDP.
