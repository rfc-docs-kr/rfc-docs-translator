                   While advice might be passed using required arguments
                   in all interfaces to the IP layer, some transport and
                   application layer protocols cannot deduce the correct
                   advice.  These interfaces must therefore allow a
                   neutral value for advice, since either always-positive
                   or always-negative advice leads to incorrect behavior.
