     The same reasoning suggests that the value of MWD should be much
     shorter for trunking gateways or for business gateways, because they
     handle a large number of Terminations, and also because the usage
     rate of these Terminations is much higher than 10% during the peak
     busy hour, a typical value being 60%.  These Terminations, during the
     peak hour, are this expected to contribute about one transaction per
     minute to the Media Gateway Controller load. A reasonable algorithm
     is to make the value of MWD per "trunk" Termination six times shorter
     than the MWD per residential gateway, and also inversely proportional
     to the number of Terminations that are being restarted. For example
     MWD should be set to 2.5 seconds for a gateway that handles a T1
     line, or to 60 milliseconds for a gateway that handles a T3 line.
