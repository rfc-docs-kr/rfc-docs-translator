     The following illustrates the API invocations from the Media Gateway
     Controller and Media Gateways to get the Terminations in this
     scenario programmed for idle behavior.  Both the originating and
     terminating Media Gateways have idle AnalogLine Terminations
     programmed to look for call initiation events (i.e.-offhook) by using
     the Modify Command with the appropriate parameters.  The null Context
     is used to indicate that the Terminations are not yet involved in a
     Context. The ROOT termination is used to indicate the entire MG
     instead of a termination within the MG.
