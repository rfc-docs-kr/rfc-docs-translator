     Hierarchical delegation of addresses in this manner implies that
     sites with addresses assigned out of a given service provider are,
     for routing purposes, part of that service provider and will be
     routed via its infrastructure.  This implies that routing information
     about multi-homed organizations (i.e., organizations connected to
     more than one network service provider) will still need to be known
     by higher levels in the hierarchy.
