     If the authorization server has directed interim accounting to be
     enabled, the Diameter client MUST produce additional records between
     the START_RECORD and STOP_RECORD, marked INTERIM_RECORD.  The
     production of these records is directed by Acct-Interim-Interval as
     well as any re-authentication or re-authorization of the session.
     The Diameter client MUST overwrite any previous interim accounting
     records that are locally stored for delivery, if a new record is
     being generated for the same session.  This ensures that only one
     pending interim record can exist on an access device for any given
     session.
