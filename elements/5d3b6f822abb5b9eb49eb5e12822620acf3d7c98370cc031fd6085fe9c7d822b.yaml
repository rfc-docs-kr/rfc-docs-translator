     The only commonly understood method for reducing routing state on a
     packet-switched network is through aggregation of information.  For
     CIDR to succeed in reducing the size and growth rate of the global
     routing system, the IPv4 address assignment process needed to be
     changed to make possible the aggregation of routing information along
     topological lines.  Since, in general, the topology of the network is
     determined by the service providers who have built it, topologically
     significant address assignments are necessarily service-provider
     oriented.
