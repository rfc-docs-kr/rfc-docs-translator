              (1) Match the Area ID of the receiving interface.  In this
                  case, the packet has been sent over a single hop.
                  Therefore, the packet's IP source address is required to
                  be on the same network as the receiving interface.  This
                  can be verified by comparing the packet's IP source
                  address to the interface's IP address, after masking
                  both addresses with the interface mask.  This comparison
                  should not be performed on point-to-point networks. On
                  point-to-point networks, the interface addresses of each
                  end of the link are assigned independently, if they are
                  assigned at all.
