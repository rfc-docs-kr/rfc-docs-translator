     If both agents use the lite mode, no connectivity checks are sent,
     and additional procedures (e.g., media-level security) are needed to
     validate the connection.  The lack of connectivity checks is
     especially problematic if one of the hosts is behind a NAT and has an
     address from a private address space: the peer may accidentally
     connect to a host in a different subnet that uses the same private
     address space.  This is one of the reasons why the lite mode is not
     appropriate for an ICE agent located behind a NAT.
