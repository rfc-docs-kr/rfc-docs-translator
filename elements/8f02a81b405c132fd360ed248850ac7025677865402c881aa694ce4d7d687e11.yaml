     DNAv4 applies only to previously configured addresses that had some
     lease lifetime associated with them, during which lifetime the
     address may be legitimately regarded as being reserved for exclusive
     use by the assigned host.  DHCP-assigned addresses fit this
     description, but IPv4 Link-Local address [RFC3927] do not, since IPv4
     Link-Local addresses are not handed out by an authoritative server
     and do not come with any guaranteed usable lifetime.
