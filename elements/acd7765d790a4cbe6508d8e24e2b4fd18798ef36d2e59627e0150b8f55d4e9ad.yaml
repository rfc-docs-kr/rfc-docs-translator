     Per-packet authentication, integrity, and replay protection of result
     indications protects against spoofing.  Since protected result
     indications require use of a key for per-packet authentication and
     integrity protection, methods supporting protected result indications
     MUST also support the "key derivation", "mutual authentication",
     "integrity protection", and "replay protection" claims.
