     1. When a Media Gateway is powered on, it should initiate a restart
        timer to a random value, uniformly distributed between 0 and a
        maximum waiting delay (MWD). Care should be taken to avoid
        synchronicity of the random number generation between multiple
        Media Gateways that would use the same algorithm.
