     If a valid ARP Reply is received, the MAC address in the sender
     hardware address field (ar$sha) in the ARP Reply is matched against
     the target hardware address field (ar$tpa) in the ARP Request, and
     the IPv4 address in the sender protocol address field (ar$spa) of the
     ARP Reply is matched against the target protocol address field
     (ar$tpa) in the ARP Request.  If a match is found, then the host
     continues to use that IPv4 address, subject to the lease re-
     acquisition and expiration behavior described in Section 4.4.5 of the
     DHCP specification [RFC2131].
