           It would be ideal if a host implementation of the Internet
           protocol suite could be entirely self-configuring.  This would
           allow the whole suite to be implemented in ROM or cast into
           silicon, it would simplify diskless workstations, and it would
           be an immense boon to harried LAN administrators as well as
           system vendors.  We have not reached this ideal; in fact, we
           are not even close.
