              When using Null authentication, the checksum field in the
              OSPF header must be verified. It must be set to the 16-bit
              one's complement of the one's complement sum of all the 16-
              bit words in the packet, excepting the authentication field.
              (If the packet's length is not an integral number of 16-bit
              words, the packet is padded with a byte of zero before
              checksumming.)
