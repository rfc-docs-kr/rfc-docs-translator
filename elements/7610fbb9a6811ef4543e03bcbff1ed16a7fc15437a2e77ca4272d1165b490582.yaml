     The Accounting-Sub-Session-Id AVP (AVP Code 287) is of type
     Unsigned64 and contains the accounting sub-session identifier.  The
     combination of the Session-Id and this AVP MUST be unique per sub-
     session, and the value of this AVP MUST be monotonically increased by
     one for all new sub-sessions.  The absence of this AVP implies no
     sub-sessions are in use, with the exception of an Accounting-Request
     whose Accounting-Record-Type is set to STOP_RECORD.  A STOP_RECORD
     message with no Accounting-Sub-Session-Id AVP present will signal the
     termination of all sub-sessions for a given Session-Id.
