          During and after the Database Exchange Process, each router has
          a list of those LSAs for which the neighbor has more up-to-date
          instances.  These LSAs are requested in Link State Request
          Packets.  Link State Request packets that are not satisfied are
          retransmitted at fixed intervals of time RxmtInterval.  When the
          Database Description Process has completed and all Link State
          Requests have been satisfied, the databases are deemed
          synchronized and the routers are marked fully adjacent.  At this
          time the adjacency is fully functional and is advertised in the
          two routers' router-LSAs.
