     But even if renumbering has to happen, we have to observe that with
     Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) an enterprise that is connected
     to the Internet may be encouraged to renumber its public hosts, as it
     changes its Network Service Providers.  Thus renumbering is likely to
     happen more often in the future, regardless of whether an enterprise
     does or does not use the addresses out of the block allocated for
     private networks.  Tools to facilitate renumbering (e.g., DHCP) would
     certainly make it less of a concern.
