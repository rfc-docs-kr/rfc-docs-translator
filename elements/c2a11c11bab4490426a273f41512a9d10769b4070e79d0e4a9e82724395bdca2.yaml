     Clearly, this is not a very conservative assumption in the Internet
     environment nor can 100% adoption of this proposal be expected.

     providers, at the end of the target three years, global routing table
     size will be "only" 4700 + 800 + 145 + 7500 = 13145 routes -- without

     during that time period.
