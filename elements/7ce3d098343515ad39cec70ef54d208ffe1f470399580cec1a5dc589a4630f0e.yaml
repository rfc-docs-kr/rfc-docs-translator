     Note that, since the recognition and synthesizer resources are in the
     same session on the same server, to obtain a faster response the
     server might have internally relayed the start-of-input condition to
     the synthesizer directly, before receiving the expected BARGE-IN-
     OCCURRED event.  However, any such communication is outside the scope
     of MRCPv2.

  인식 및 합성기 리소스가 동일한 서버의 동일한 세션에 있으므로 더 빠른 응답을 얻기 위해 서버는 예상된 BARGE-IN-OCCURRED 이벤트를 수신하기 전에 합성기에 직접 입력 시작 조건을 내부적으로 전달했을 수 있습니다. 그러나 그러한 통신은 MRCPv2의 범위를 벗어납니다.
