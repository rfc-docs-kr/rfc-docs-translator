     o  Web servers SHOULD use HSTS to indicate that they are willing to
        accept TLS-only clients, unless they are deployed in such a way
        that using HSTS would in fact weaken overall security (e.g., it
        can be problematic to use HSTS with self-signed certificates, as
        described in Section 11.3 of [RFC6797]).

  - 웹 서버는 HSTS를 사용하여 실제로 전체 보안을 약화시키는 방식으로 배포되지 않는 한 TLS 전용 클라이언트를 허용할 의사가 있음을 나타내기 위해 HSTS를 사용해야 합니다(예: 자체 서명된 HSTS를 사용하는 것이 문제가 될 수 있음). [RFC6797]의 섹션 11.3에 설명된 대로 인증서).
