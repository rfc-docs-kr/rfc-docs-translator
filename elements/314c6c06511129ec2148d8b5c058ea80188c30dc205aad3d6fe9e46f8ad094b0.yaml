     The other dtmf characters are specified in exactly the same way. A
     table with all signal names and signal IDs is included.  Note that
     each dtmf character is defined as both a signal and a toneid, thus
     extending the basic tone generation package.  Also note that dtmf
     SignalIds are different from the names used in a digit map.
