     Each AFm class applies a Two Rate Three Color Meter, dividing traffic
     into three groups.  These groups of traffic conform to both specified
     rates, only the higher one, or none.  The intent, on the ingress
     interface at the edge of the network, is to measure and appropriately
     mark traffic.
