     The URL host was defined as a fully-qualified domain name.  However,
     many URLs are used without fully-qualified domain names (in contexts
     for which the full qualification is not necessary), without any host
     (as in some file URLs), or with a host of "localhost".

  URL 호스트가 정규화된 도메인 이름으로 정의되었습니다. 그러나 많은 URL은 정규화된 도메인 이름 없이(전체 정규화가 필요하지 않은 컨텍스트에서) 호스트 없이(일부 파일 URL에서처럼) 또는 "localhost" 호스트와 함께 사용됩니다.
