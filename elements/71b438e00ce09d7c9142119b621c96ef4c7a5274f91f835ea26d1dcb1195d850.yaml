        For example, let's suppose that the XYZ corporation does a lot of
        business with MBII. In this case, XYZ and MBII may contract with a
        carrier to provide a private link between the two corporations,
        where this link may only be used for packets whose source is
        within one of the two corporations, and whose destination is
        within the other of the two corporations. Finally, suppose that
        the point-to-point link is connected between a single router
        (router X) within XYZ corporation and a single router (router M)
        within MBII. It is therefore necessary to configure router X to
        know which addresses can be reached over this link (specifically,
        all addresses reachable in MBII). Similarly, it is necessary to
        configure router M to know which addresses can be reached over
        this link (specifically, all addresses reachable in XYZ
        Corporation).
