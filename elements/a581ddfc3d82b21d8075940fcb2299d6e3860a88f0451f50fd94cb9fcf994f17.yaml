  -- Entries in the classifier element table serves as the anchor for
  -- each classification pattern, defined in filter table entries.  Each
  -- classifier element table entry also specifies the subsequent
  -- downstream Differentiated Services Functional Data Path Element when
  -- the classification pattern is satisfied. Each entry in the
  -- classifier element table describes one branch of the fan-out
  -- characteristic of a classifier indicated in the Informal
  -- Differentiated Services Model section 4.1.  A classifier is composed
  -- of one or more classifier elements.
