      The topology of an area is invisible from the outside of the area.
      Conversely, routers internal to a given area know nothing of the
      detailed topology external to the area.  This isolation of knowledge
      enables the protocol to effect a marked reduction in routing traffic
      as compared to treating the entire Autonomous System as a single
      link-state domain.
