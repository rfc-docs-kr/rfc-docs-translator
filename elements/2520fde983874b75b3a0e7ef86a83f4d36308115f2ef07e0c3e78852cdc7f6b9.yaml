          The top of Figure 1a shows two routers connected by a point-to-
          point link. In the resulting link-state database graph, the two
          router vertices are directly connected by a pair of edges, one
          in each direction. Interfaces to point-to-point networks need
          not be assigned IP addresses.  When interface addresses are
          assigned, they are modelled as stub links, with each router
          advertising a stub connection to the other router's interface
          address. Optionally, an IP subnet can be assigned to the point-
          to-point network. In this case, both routers advertise a stub
          link to the IP subnet, instead of advertising each others' IP
          interface addresses.
