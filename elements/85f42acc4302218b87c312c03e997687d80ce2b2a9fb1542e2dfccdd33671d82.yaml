     Over the last few years, there have been several major attacks on TLS
     [RFC5246], including attacks on its most commonly used ciphers and
     modes of operation.  Details are given in Section 2, but a quick
     summary is that both AES-CBC and RC4, which together make up for most
     current usage, have been seriously attacked in the context of TLS.
