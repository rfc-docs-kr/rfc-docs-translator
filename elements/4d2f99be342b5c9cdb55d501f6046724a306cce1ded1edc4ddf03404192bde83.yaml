      Authentication key
          This configured data allows the authentication procedure to
          generate and/or verify OSPF protocol packets.  The
          Authentication key can be configured on a per-interface basis.
          For example, if the AuType indicates simple password, the
          Authentication key would be a 64-bit clear password which is
          inserted into the OSPF packet header. If instead Autype
          indicates Cryptographic authentication, then the Authentication
          key is a shared secret which enables the generation/verification
          of message digests which are appended to the OSPF protocol
          packets. When Cryptographic authentication is used, multiple
          simultaneous keys are supported in order to achieve smooth key
          transition (see Section D.3).
