          (6) If the attached network is an NBMA network, and the router
              itself has just become either Designated Router or Backup
              Designated Router, it must start sending Hello Packets to
              those neighbors that are not eligible to become Designated
              Router (see Section 9.5.1).  This is done by invoking the
              neighbor event Start for each neighbor having a Router
              Priority of 0.
