        DISCUSSION:
             Applications are urged to make use of these mechanisms where
             applicable, even when the mechanisms are not currently
             effective in the Internet (e.g., TOS).  This will allow these
             mechanisms to be immediately useful when they do become
             effective, without a large amount of retrofitting of host
             software.
