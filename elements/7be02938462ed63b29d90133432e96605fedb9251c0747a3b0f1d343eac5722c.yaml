     Messages, being carried over TCP, are not subject to transport
     losses, but loss of a transaction request or its reply may
     nonetheless be noted in real implementations. In the absence of a
     timely response, commands are repeated. Most commands are not
     idempotent.  The state of the MG would become unpredictable if, for
