     The TIME attack can be mitigated by disabling TLS compression.  We
     are not aware of mitigations at the TLS protocol level to the BREACH
     attack, and so application-level mitigations are needed (see
     [BREACH]).  For example, implementations of HTTP that use Cross-Site
     Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens will need to randomize them.  Even the
     best practices and recommendations from [SECURE-TLS] are insufficient
     to thwart this attack.
