                ICMP is a control protocol that is considered to be an
                integral part of IP, although it is architecturally
                layered upon IP, i.e., it uses IP to carry its data end-
                to-end just as a transport protocol like TCP or UDP does.
                ICMP provides error reporting, congestion reporting, and
                first-hop gateway redirection.
