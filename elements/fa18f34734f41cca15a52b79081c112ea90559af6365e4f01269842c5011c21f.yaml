     If an MRCP client notices that the underlying connection has been
     closed for one of its MRCP channels, and it has not previously
     initiated a re-INVITE to close that channel, it MUST send a BYE to
     close down the SIP dialog and all other MRCP channels.  If an MRCP
     server notices that the underlying connection has been closed for one
     of its MRCP channels, and it has not previously received and accepted
     a re-INVITE closing that channel, then it MUST send a BYE to close
     down the SIP dialog and all other MRCP channels.
