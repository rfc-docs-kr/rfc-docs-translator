           o  A potential blind reset attack is described in RFC 5961 [9].
              The mitigation described in that document has specific
              applicability explained therein, and is not a substitute for
              cryptographic protection (e.g., IPsec or TCP-AO).  A TCP
              implementation that supports the mitigation described in RFC
              5961 SHOULD first check that the sequence number exactly
              matches RCV.NXT prior to executing the action in the next
              paragraph.
