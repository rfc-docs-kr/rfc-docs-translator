      Link State Acknowledgment Packets are OSPF packet type 5.  To make
      the flooding of LSAs reliable, flooded LSAs are explicitly
      acknowledged.  This acknowledgment is accomplished through the
      sending and receiving of Link State Acknowledgment packets.
      Multiple LSAs can be acknowledged in a single Link State
      Acknowledgment packet.
