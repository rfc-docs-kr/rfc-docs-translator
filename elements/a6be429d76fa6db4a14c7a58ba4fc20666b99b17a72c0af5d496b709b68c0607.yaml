     A potential denial-of-service threat exists for data encodings using
     compression techniques that have non-uniform receiver-end
     computational load.  The attacker can inject pathological datagrams
     into the stream which are complex to decode and cause the receiver to
     be overloaded.  However, this encoding does not exhibit any
     significant non-uniformity.
