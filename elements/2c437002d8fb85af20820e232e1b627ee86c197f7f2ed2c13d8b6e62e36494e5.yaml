           (2)  If excludedSubtrees is present in the certificate, set the
                excluded_subtrees state variable to the union of its
                previous value and the value indicated in the extension
                field.  If excludedSubtrees does not include a particular
                name type, the excluded_subtrees state variable is
                unchanged for that name type.  For example, the union of
                the name spaces example.com and foo.example.com is
                example.com.  And the union of example.com and example.net
                is both name spaces.
