          The above procedure may elect the same router to be both
          Designated Router and Backup Designated Router, although that
          router will never be the calculating router (Router X) itself.
          The elected Designated Router may not be the router having the
          highest Router Priority, nor will the Backup Designated Router
          necessarily have the second highest Router Priority.  If Router
          X is not itself eligible to become Designated Router, it is
          possible that neither a Backup Designated Router nor a
          Designated Router will be selected in the above procedure.  Note
          also that if Router X is the only attached router that is
          eligible to become Designated Router, it will select itself as
          Designated Router and there will be no Backup Designated Router
          for the network.
