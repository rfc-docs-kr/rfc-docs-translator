                   The performance increase resulting from the use of
                   these improvements varies from noticeable to dramatic.
                   Jacobson's algorithm for incorporating the measured RTT
                   variance is especially important on a low-speed link,
                   where the natural variation of packet sizes causes a
                   large variation in RTT.  One vendor found link
                   utilization on a 9.6kb line went from 10% to 90% as a
                   result of implementing Jacobson's variance algorithm in
                   TCP.
