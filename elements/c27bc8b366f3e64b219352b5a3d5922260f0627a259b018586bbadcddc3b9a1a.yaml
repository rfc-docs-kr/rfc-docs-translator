     NETCONF allows a client to discover the set of protocol extensions
     supported by a server.  These "capabilities" permit the client to
     adjust its behavior to take advantage of the features exposed by the
     device.  The capability definitions can be easily extended in a
     noncentralized manner.  Standard and non-standard capabilities can be
     defined with semantic and syntactic rigor.  Capabilities are
     discussed in Section 8.
