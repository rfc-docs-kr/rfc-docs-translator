        The optional Network Appearance parameter field identifies the SS7
        network context for the Routing Key, and it has the same format as
        in the DATA message (see Section 3.3.1) with the exception that it
        does not have to be the first parameter in the message.  If the
        Network Appearance is not specified and the Routing Key applies to
        all Network Appearances, then this Routing Key MUST be the only
        one registered for the association; that is, Routing Context is
        implied, and DATA and SSNM messages are discriminated on Network
        Appearance rather than on Routing Context.  Where Network
        Appearance is not specified and there is only one Network
        Appearance, then Network Appearance is implied.  Its format is:
