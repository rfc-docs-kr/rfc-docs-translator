           - If the route being announced was learned from an internal
             peer or is locally originated, the BGP speaker can use an
             interface address of the internal peer router (or the
             internal router) through which the announced network is
             reachable for the speaker for the NEXT_HOP attribute,
             provided that peer X shares a common subnet with this
             address.  This is a form of "third party" NEXT_HOP attribute.
