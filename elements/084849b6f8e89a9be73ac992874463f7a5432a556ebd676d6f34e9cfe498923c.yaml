          Slave
              Sets the DD sequence number in the neighbor data structure
              to the DD sequence number appearing in the received packet.
              The slave must send a Database Description Packet in reply.
              If the received packet has the more bit (M) set to 0, and
              the packet to be sent by the slave will also have the M-bit
              set to 0, the neighbor event ExchangeDone is generated.
              Note that the slave always generates this event before the
              master.
