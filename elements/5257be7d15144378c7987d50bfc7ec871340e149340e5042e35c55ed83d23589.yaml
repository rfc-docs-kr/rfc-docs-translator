     Therefore, when traffic arrives at an ingress or egress interface,
     the first step in applying the policy is determining what policy
     applies.  This MIB does that by providing a table of pointers to the
     first functional data path element, indexed by interface and
     direction on that interface.  The content of the
     diffServDataPathEntry is a single RowPointer, which points to that
     functional data path element.
