                The provisions of this section were designed to provide
                direct interoperation between 894-capable and 1042-capable
                systems on the same cable, to the maximum extent possible.
                It is intended to support the present situation where
                894-only systems predominate, while providing an easy
                transition to a possible future in which 1042-capable
                systems become common.
