     It is necessary for a Diameter server that authorized a session, for
     which it is maintaining state, to be notified when that session is no
     longer active, both for tracking purposes as well as to allow
     stateful agents to release any resources that they may have provided
     for the user's session.  For sessions whose state is not being
     maintained, this section is not used.
