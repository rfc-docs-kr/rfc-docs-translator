     o  Network Access Server (NAS) devices (e.g., a switch or access
        point) do not have to understand each authentication method and
        MAY act as a pass-through agent for a backend authentication
        server.  Support for pass-through is optional.  An authenticator
        MAY authenticate local peers, while at the same time acting as a
        pass-through for non-local peers and authentication methods it
        does not implement locally.
