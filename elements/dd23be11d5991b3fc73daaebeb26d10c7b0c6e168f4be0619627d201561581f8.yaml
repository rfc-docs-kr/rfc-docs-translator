     The optional ModemDescriptor and MuxDescriptor specify a modem and
     multiplexer if applicable. For convenience, if a Multiplex Descriptor
     is present in an Add command and lists any Terminations that are not
     currently in the Context, such Terminations are added to the context
     as if individual Add commands listing the Terminations were invoked.
     If an error occurs on such an implied Add, error 471 - Implied Add
     for Multiplex failure shall be returned and further processing of the
     command shall cease.
