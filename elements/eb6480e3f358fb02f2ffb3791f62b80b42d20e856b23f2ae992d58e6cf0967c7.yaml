        In RTSP 1.0, there was a minimal implementation section.  However,
        that was not consistent with the rest of the specification.  So,
        rather than making an attempt to explicitly enumerate the features
        for play.basic, this specification has to be taken as a whole and
        the necessary features normatively defined as being required are
        included.

  - RTSP 1.0에는 최소한의 구현 부분이 있었습니다. 그러나 이는 나머지 사양과 일치하지 않았습니다. 따라서 play.basic의 기능을 명시적으로 열거하기보다는 이 사양을 전체적으로 받아들여야 하며 규범적으로 필수로 정의된 필수 기능이 포함되어야 합니다.
