     A "Realm Specific IP Server" (RSIP server) is a node resident on both
     private and external realms, that can facilitate routing of external
     realm packets within a private realm. These packets may either have
     been originated by an RSIP client or directed to an RSIP-client.
     RSIP-Server may also be the same node that assigns external realm
     addresses to RSIP-Clients.
