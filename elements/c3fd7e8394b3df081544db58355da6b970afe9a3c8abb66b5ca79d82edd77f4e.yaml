                        The Strong ES (End System, i.e., host) model
                        emphasizes the host/gateway (ES/IS) distinction,
                        and would therefore substitute MUST for MAY in
                        issues (A) and (B) above.  It tends to model a
                        multihomed host as a set of logical hosts within
                        the same physical host.
