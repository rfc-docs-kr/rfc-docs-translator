        (b)  Policy Certification Authorities (PCAs):  PCAs are at level 2
             of the hierarchy, each PCA being certified by the IPRA.  A
             PCA shall establish and publish a statement of its policy
             with respect to certifying users or subordinate certification
             authorities.  Distinct PCAs aim to satisfy different user
             needs.  For example, one PCA (an organizational PCA) might
             support the general electronic mail needs of commercial
             organizations, and another PCA (a high-assurance PCA) might
             have a more stringent policy designed for satisfying legally
             binding digital signature requirements.
