     Although in many ICN architectures the source of a request is not
     explicitly identified, an attacker may be able to obtain considerable
     information if he or she can monitor transactions on the cache and
     obtain details of the objects accessed, the topological direction of
     requests, and information about the timing of transactions.  The
     persistence of data in the cache can make life easier for an attacker
     by giving a longer timescale for analysis.
