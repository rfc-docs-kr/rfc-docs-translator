     In the case of a Broadcast mode AS, the SGP moves the ASP to the
     ASP-INACTIVE state, and the AS traffic is broadcast only to the
     remaining ASPs in the state ASP-ACTIVE.  A Notify message
     ("Insufficient ASP resources active in AS") MAY be sent to all
     inactive ASPs, if required.  An ASP Inactive Ack message is sent to
     the ASP after all traffic is halted, and Layer Management is informed
     with an M-ASP_INACTIVE indication primitive.
