     The authorization server (chain) directs the selection of proper
     transfer strategy, based on its knowledge of the user and
     relationships of roaming partnerships.  The server (or agents) uses
     the Acct-Interim-Interval and Accounting-Realtime-Required AVPs to
     control the operation of the Diameter peer operating as a client.
     The Acct-Interim-Interval AVP, when present, instructs the Diameter
     node acting as a client to produce accounting records continuously
     even during a session.  Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP is used to
     control the behavior of the client when the transfer of accounting
     records from the Diameter client is delayed or unsuccessful.
