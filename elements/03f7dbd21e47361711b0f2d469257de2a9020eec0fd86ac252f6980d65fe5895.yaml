     Speaker Verifier
                    A resource capable of verifying the authenticity of a
                    claimed identity by matching a media stream containing
                    spoken input to a pre-existing voiceprint.  This may
                    also involve matching the caller's voice against more
                    than one voiceprint, also called multi-verification or
                    speaker identification.
