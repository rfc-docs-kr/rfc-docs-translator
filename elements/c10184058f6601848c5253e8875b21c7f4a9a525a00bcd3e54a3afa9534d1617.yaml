     A stateful agent is one that maintains session state information by
     keeping track of all authorized active sessions.  Each authorized
     session is bound to a particular service, and its state is considered
     active until either the agent is notified otherwise or the session
     expires.  Each authorized session has an expiration, which is
     communicated by Diameter servers via the Session-Timeout AVP.
