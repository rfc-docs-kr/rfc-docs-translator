        The Routing Context parameter contains the Routing Context value
        associated with the DATA message.  Where a Routing Key has not
        been coordinated between the SGP and ASP, sending of Routing
        Context is not required.  Where multiple Routing Keys and Routing
        Contexts are used across a common association, the Routing Context
        MUST be sent to identify the traffic flow, assisting in the
        internal distribution of Data messages.
