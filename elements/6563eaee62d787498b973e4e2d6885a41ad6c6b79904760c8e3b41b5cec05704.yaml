     There are many reasons why ICE support for TCP is important.  First,
     there are media protocols that only run over TCP.  Such protocols are
     used, for example, for screen sharing and instant messaging
     [RFC4975].  For these protocols to work in the presence of NAT,
     unless they define their own NAT traversal mechanisms, ICE support
     for TCP is needed.  In addition, RTP can also run over TCP [RFC4571].
     Typically, it is preferable to run RTP over UDP, and not TCP.
     However, in a variety of network environments, overly restrictive NAT
     and firewall devices prevent UDP-based communications altogether, but
     general TCP-based communications are permitted.  In such
     environments, sending RTP over TCP, and thus establishing the media
     session, may be preferable to having it fail altogether.  With this
     specification, agents can gather UDP and TCP candidates for a media
     stream, list the UDP ones with higher priority, and then only use the
     TCP-based ones if the UDP ones fail.  This provides a fallback
     mechanism that allows multimedia communications to be highly
     reliable.
