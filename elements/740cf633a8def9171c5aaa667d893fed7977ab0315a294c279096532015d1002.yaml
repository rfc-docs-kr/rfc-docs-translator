     Recorder
                    A resource capable of recording audio and providing a
                    URI pointer to the recording.  A recorder MUST provide
                    endpointing capabilities for suppressing silence at
                    the beginning and end of a recording, and MAY also
                    suppress silence in the middle of a recording.  If
                    such suppression is done, the recorder MUST maintain
                    timing metadata to indicate the actual timestamps of
                    the recorded media.
