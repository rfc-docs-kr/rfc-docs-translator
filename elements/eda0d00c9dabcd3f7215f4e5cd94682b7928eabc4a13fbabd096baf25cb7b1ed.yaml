        -  SND.NXT is set to ISS+1 and SND.UNA to ISS.  The connection
           state should be changed to SYN-RECEIVED.  Note that any other
           incoming control or data (combined with SYN) will be processed
           in the SYN-RECEIVED state, but processing of SYN and ACK should
           not be repeated.  If the listen was not fully specified (i.e.,
           the remote socket was not fully specified), then the
           unspecified fields should be filled in now.

  - SND.NXT는 ISS+1로, SND.UNA는 ISS로 설정됩니다. 연결 상태를 SYN-RECEIVED로 변경해야 합니다. 다른 모든 수신 제어 또는 데이터(SYN과 결합)는 SYN-RECEIVED 상태에서 처리되지만 SYN 및 ACK 처리는 반복되어서는 안 됩니다. 청취가 완전히 지정되지 않은 경우(즉, 원격 소켓이 완전히 지정되지 않은 경우) 지정되지 않은 필드를 지금 채워야 합니다.
