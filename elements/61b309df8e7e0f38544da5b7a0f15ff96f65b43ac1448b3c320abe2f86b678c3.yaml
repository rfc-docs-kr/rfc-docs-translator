              The age of an LSA is never incremented past MaxAge.  LSAs
              having age MaxAge are not used in the routing table
              calculation.  When an LSA's age first reaches MaxAge, it is
              reflooded.  An LSA of age MaxAge is finally flushed from the
              database when it is no longer needed to ensure database
              synchronization.  For more information on the aging of LSAs,
              consult Section 14.
