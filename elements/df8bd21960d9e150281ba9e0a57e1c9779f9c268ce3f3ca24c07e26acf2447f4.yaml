              This is the initial interface state.  In this state, the
              lower-level protocols have indicated that the interface is
              unusable.  No protocol traffic at all will be sent or
              received on such a interface.  In this state, interface
              parameters should be set to their initial values.  All
              interface timers should be disabled, and there should be no
              adjacencies associated with the interface.
