     In simplistic transport terms, the SG will terminate SS7 MTP2 and
     MTP3 protocol layers [7,8,9] and deliver ISUP, SCCP, and/or any other
     MTP3-User protocol messages, as well as certain MTP network
     management events, over SCTP transport associations to MTP3-User
     peers in MGCs or IP-resident databases.
