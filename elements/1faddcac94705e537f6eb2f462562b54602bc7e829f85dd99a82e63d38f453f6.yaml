     record_overflow:  A TLSCiphertext record was received that had a
        length more than 2^14 + 256 bytes, or a record decrypted to a
        TLSPlaintext record with more than 2^14 bytes (or some other
        negotiated limit).  This alert should never be observed in
        communication between proper implementations, except when messages
        were corrupted in the network.

  Record_overflow: 길이가 2^14 + 256바이트를 초과하는 TLSCiphertext 레코드가 수신되었거나 2^14바이트(또는 기타 협상된 제한)를 초과하는 TLSPlaintext 레코드로 해독된 레코드가 수신되었습니다. 네트워크에서 메시지가 손상된 경우를 제외하고는 적절한 구현 간의 통신에서 이 경고를 관찰해서는 안 됩니다.
