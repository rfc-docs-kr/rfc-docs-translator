        The Data field is specified as a sequence of AVPs.  These AVPs are
        concatenated -- including their headers and padding -- in the
        order in which they are specified and the result encapsulated in
        the Data field.  The AVP Length field is set to 8 (12 if the 'V'
        bit is enabled) plus the total length of all included AVPs,
        including their headers and padding.  Thus, the AVP Length field
        of an AVP of type Grouped is always a multiple of 4.
