     The Control-Client MAY set a desired code point in the Diffserv Code
     Point (DSCP) field in the IP header for ALL packets of a specific
     control connection.  The Server SHOULD use the DSCP of the Control-
     Client's TCP SYN in ALL subsequent packets on that connection
     (avoiding any ambiguity in case of re-marking).
