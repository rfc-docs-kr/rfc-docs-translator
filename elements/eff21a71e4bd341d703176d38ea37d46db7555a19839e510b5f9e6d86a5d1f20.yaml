     Additional Values
     -----------------
     dt (0x0030) is defined as a tone id for playtone
     The other tones of this package are defined in exactly the same way.
     A table with all signal names and  signal IDs is included.  Note
     that each tone is defined as both a signal and a toneid, thus
     extending the basic tone generation package.
