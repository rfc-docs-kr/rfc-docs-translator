           This command terminates a USER, flushing all I/O and account
           information, except to allow any transfer in progress to be
           completed.  All parameters are reset to the default settings
           and the control connection is left open.  This is identical to
           the state in which a user finds himself immediately after the
           control connection is opened.  A USER command may be expected
           to follow.
