     If the client receives the 454 response, the client must decide
     whether or not to continue the SMTP session.  Such a decision is
     based on local policy.  For instance, if TLS was being used for
     client authentication, the client might try to continue the session,
     in case the server allows it even with no authentication.  However,
     if TLS was being negotiated for encryption, a client that gets a 454
     response needs to decide whether to send the message anyway with no
     TLS encryption, whether to wait and try again later, or whether to
     give up and notify the sender of the error.
