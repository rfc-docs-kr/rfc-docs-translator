          Interface
              The connection between a router and one of its attached
              networks.  An interface has state information associated
              with it, which is obtained from the underlying lower level
              protocols and the routing protocol itself.  An interface to
              a network has associated with it a single IP address and
              mask (unless the network is an unnumbered point-to-point
              network).  An interface is sometimes also referred to as a
              link.
