     Note: The requirement that the server request a certificate is just a
     restatement of the TLS protocol rules, e.g., Section 7.4.6 of
     [RFC5246].  The requirement that the client not send a certificate
     not known to be acceptable to the server is pragmatic in multiple
     ways: the current TLS protocol provides no way for the client to know
     which of the potentially multiple certificates it should use; also,
     when the client sends a certificate, it is potentially disclosing its
     identity (or its user's identity) to both the server and any party
     with access to the transmission medium, perhaps unnecessarily and for
     no useful purpose.
