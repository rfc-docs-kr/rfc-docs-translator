             Action:  The action for event BadLSReq is exactly the same as
                      for the neighbor event SeqNumberMismatch.  The
                      (possibly partially formed) adjacency is torn down,
                      and then an attempt is made at reestablishment.  For
                      more information, see the neighbor state machine
                      entry that is invoked when event SeqNumberMismatch
                      is generated in state Exchange or greater.
