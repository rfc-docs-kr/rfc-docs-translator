     To meet the stringent SS7 signalling reliability and performance
     requirements for carrier grade networks, Network Operators might
     require that no single point of failure is present in the end-to-end
     network architecture between an SS7 node and an IP-based application.
     This can typically be achieved through the use of redundant SGPs or
     SGs, redundant hosts, and the provision of redundant QOS-bounded IP
     network paths for SCTP Associations between SCTP End Points.
     Obviously, the reliability of the SG, the MGC, and other IP-based
     functional elements also needs to be taken into account.  The
     distribution of ASPs and SGPs within the available Hosts MAY also be
     considered.  As an example, for a particular Application Server, the
     related ASPs could be distributed over at least two Hosts.
