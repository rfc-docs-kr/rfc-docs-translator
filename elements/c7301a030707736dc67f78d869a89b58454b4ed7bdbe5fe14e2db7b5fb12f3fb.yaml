              (d) At this point we are not positive that the neighbor has
                  an up-to-date instance of this new LSA.  Add the new LSA
                  to the Link state retransmission list for the adjacency.
                  This ensures that the flooding procedure is reliable;
                  the LSA will be retransmitted at intervals until an
                  acknowledgment is seen from the neighbor.
