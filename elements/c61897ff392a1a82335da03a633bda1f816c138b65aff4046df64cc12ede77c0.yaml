     The most straightforward case of this occurs when there is a set of
     routing domains which are all attached to a single service provider
     domain (e.g., regional network), and which use that provider for all
     external (inter-domain) traffic.  A small prefix may be given to the
     provider, which then gives slightly longer prefixes (based on the
     provider's prefix) to each of the routing domains that it
     interconnects. This allows the provider, when informing other routing
     domains of the addresses that it can reach, to abbreviate the
     reachability information for a large number of routing domains as a
     single prefix. This approach therefore can allow a great deal of
     hierarchical abbreviation of routing information, and thereby can
     greatly improve the scalability of inter-domain routing.
