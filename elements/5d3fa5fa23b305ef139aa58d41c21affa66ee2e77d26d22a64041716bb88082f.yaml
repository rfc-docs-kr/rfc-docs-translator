     If after the initial EAP authentication, data packets are sent
     without per-packet authentication, integrity, and replay protection,
     an attacker with access to the media can inject packets, "flip bits"
     within existing packets, replay packets, or even hijack the session
     completely.  Without per-packet confidentiality, it is possible to
     snoop data packets.
