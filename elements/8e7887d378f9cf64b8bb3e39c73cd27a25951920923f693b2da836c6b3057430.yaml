     Typically, the Dynamic Authorization Server will extract the realm
     from the Network Access Identifier [RFC4282] included within the
     User-Name or Chargeable-User-Identity Attribute, and determine the
     corresponding RADIUS servers in the realm routing tables.  If the
     Dynamic Authorization Server maintains long-term session state, it
     MAY perform the authorization check based on the session
     identification attributes in the CoA-Request.  The session
     identification attributes can be used to tie a session to a
     particular proxy or set of proxies, as with the NAI realm.
