     CmprI               4-bit unsigned integer.  Number of prefix octets
                         from each segment, except than the last segment,
                         (i.e., segments 1 through n-1) that are elided.
                         For example, an SRH carrying full IPv6 addresses
                         in Addresses[1..n-1] sets CmprI to 0.
