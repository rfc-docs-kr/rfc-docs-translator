     Clients SHOULD be coded in such a manner as to allow the timing of
     the AUTH, PBSZ, and PROT commands to be flexible and dictated by the
     server.  It is quite reasonable for a server to refuse certain
     commands prior to these commands.  Similarly, it is quite possible
     that a SITE or quoted command might be needed by a server prior to
     the AUTH.  A client MUST allow a user to override the timing of these
     commands to suit a specific server.
