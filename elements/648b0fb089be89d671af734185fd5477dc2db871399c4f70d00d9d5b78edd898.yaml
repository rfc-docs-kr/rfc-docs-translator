     During the summer of 1968, representatives from the initial four
     sites met several times to discuss the HOST software and initial
     experiments on the network.  There emerged from these meetings a
     working group of three, Steve Carr from Utah, Jeff Rulifson from SRI,
     and Steve Crocker of UCLA, who met during the fall and winter.  The
     most recent meeting was in the last week of March in Utah.  Also
     present was Bill Duvall of SRI who has recently started working with
     Jeff Rulifson.

  1968년 여름 동안 초기 4개 사이트의 대표자들은 HOST 소프트웨어와 네트워크의 초기 실험에 대해 논의하기 위해 여러 번 만났습니다. 이 회의에서 가을과 겨울에 만난 유타 출신의 Steve Carr, SRI의 Jeff Rulifson, UCLA의 Steve Crocker 등 3명의 실무 그룹이 탄생했습니다. 가장 최근 모임은 3월 마지막 주 유타에서 열렸습니다. 또한 최근 Jeff Rulifson과 함께 작업을 시작한 SRI의 Bill Duvall도 참석했습니다.
