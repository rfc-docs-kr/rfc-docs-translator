     For indirection (as in the diffServClfrElementTable), the idea is to
     allow other MIBs, including proprietary ones, to define new and
     arcane filters - MAC headers, IPv4 and IPv6 headers, BGP Communities
     and all sorts of other things - while still utilizing the structures
     of this MIB.  This is a form of class inheritance (in "object
     oriented" language): it allows base object definitions ("classes") to
     be extended in proprietary or standard ways, in the future, by other
     documents.
