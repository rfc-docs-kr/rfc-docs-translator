     Dictionary attack resistance
        Where password authentication is used, passwords are commonly
        selected from a small set (as compared to a set of N-bit keys),
        which raises a concern about dictionary attacks.  A method may be
        said to provide protection against dictionary attacks if, when it
        uses a password as a secret, the method does not allow an offline
        attack that has a work factor based on the number of passwords in
        an attacker's dictionary.
