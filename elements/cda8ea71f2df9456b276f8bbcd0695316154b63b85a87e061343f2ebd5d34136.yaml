     max-stale      Indicates that the client is willing to allow a server
                    to utilize cached data that has exceeded its
                    expiration time.  If "max-stale" is assigned a value,
                    then the client is willing to allow the server to use
                    cached data that has exceeded its expiration time by
                    no more than the specified number of seconds.  If no
                    value is assigned to "max-stale", then the client is
                    willing to allow the server to use stale data of any
                    age.
