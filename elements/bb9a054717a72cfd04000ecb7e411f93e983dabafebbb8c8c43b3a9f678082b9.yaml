     The offer MAY be identical to the last SDP provided to the other
     party (which may have been provided in an offer or an answer), or it
     MAY be different.  We refer to the last SDP provided as the "previous
     SDP".  If the offer is the same, the answer MAY be the same as the
     previous SDP from the answerer, or it MAY be different.  If the
     offered SDP is different from the previous SDP, some constraints are
     placed on its construction, discussed below.

  제안은 상대방에게 제공된 마지막 SDP(제안이나 답변에서 제공되었을 수 있음)와 동일할 수도 있고 다를 수도 있습니다. 마지막으로 제공된 SDP를 "이전 SDP"라고 합니다. 제안이 동일하다면 답변은 답변자의 이전 SDP와 동일할 수도 있고 다를 수도 있습니다. 제공된 SDP가 이전 SDP와 다르면 아래에서 설명하는 대로 구성에 몇 가지 제약이 있습니다.
