              ________________________________________________
              1         These are the router-LSAs.
                        They describe the collected
                         states of the router's
                        interfaces. For more information,
                        consult Section 12.4.1.
              ________________________________________________
              2         These are the network-LSAs.
                        They describe the set of routers
                        attached to the network. For
                        more information, consult
                        Section 12.4.2.
              ________________________________________________
              3 or 4    These are the summary-LSAs.
                        They describe inter-area routes,
                        and enable the condensation of
                        routing information at area
                        borders. Originated by area border
                        routers, the Type 3 summary-LSAs
                        describe routes to networks while the
                        Type 4 summary-LSAs describe routes to
                        AS boundary routers.
              ________________________________________________
              5         These are the AS-external-LSAs.
                        Originated by AS boundary routers,
                        they describe routes
                        to destinations external to the
                        Autonomous System. A default route for
                        the Autonomous System can also be
                        described by an AS-external-LSA.
