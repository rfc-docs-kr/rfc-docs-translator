        Two kinds of transit routing domains are considered, direct
        providers and indirect providers. Most of the subscribers of a
        direct provider are domains that act solely as service subscribers
        (they carry no transit traffic). Most of the subscribers of an
        indirect provider are domains that, themselves, act as service
        providers. In present terminology a backbone is an indirect
        provider, while a TRD is a direct provider. Each case is discussed
        separately below.
