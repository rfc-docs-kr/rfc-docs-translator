     The ASP MAY choose to audit the availability of unavailable
     destinations by sending DAUD messages.  This would be the case when,
     for example, an AS becomes active at an ASP and does not have current
     destination statuses.  If MTP restart is in progress at the SG, the
     SGP returns a DUNA message for that destination, even if it received
     an indication that the destination became available or restricted.
