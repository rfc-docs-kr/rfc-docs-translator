                If the reassembly timeout is set too high, buffer
                resources in the receiving host will be tied up too long,
                and the MSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime) [TCP:1] will be
                larger than necessary.  The MSL controls the maximum rate
                at which fragmented datagrams can be sent using distinct
                values of the 16-bit Ident field; a larger MSL lowers the
                maximum rate.  The TCP specification [TCP:1] arbitrarily
                assumes a value of 2 minutes for MSL.  This sets an upper
                limit on a reasonable reassembly timeout value.
