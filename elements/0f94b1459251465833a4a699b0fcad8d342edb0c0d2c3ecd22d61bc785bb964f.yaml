          Point-to-point
              In this state, the interface is operational, and connects
              either to a physical point-to-point network or to a virtual
              link.  Upon entering this state, the router attempts to form
              an adjacency with the neighboring router.  Hello Packets are
              sent to the neighbor every HelloInterval seconds.
