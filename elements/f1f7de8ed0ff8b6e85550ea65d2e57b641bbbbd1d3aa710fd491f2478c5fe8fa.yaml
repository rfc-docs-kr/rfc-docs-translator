          In this example, it is assumed that RT2 has a completely up to
          date database.  In that case, RT2 goes immediately into Full
          state.  RT1 will go into Full state after updating the necessary
          parts of its database.  This is done by sending Link State
          Request Packets, and receiving Link State Update Packets in
          response.  Note that, while RT1 has waited until a complete set
          of Database Description Packets has been received (from RT2)
          before sending any Link State Request Packets, this need not be
          the case.  RT1 could have interleaved the sending of Link State
          Request Packets with the reception of Database Description
          Packets.
