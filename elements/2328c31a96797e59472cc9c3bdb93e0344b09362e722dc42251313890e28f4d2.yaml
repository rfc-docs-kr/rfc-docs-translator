          Down
              This is the initial state of a neighbor conversation.  It
              indicates that there has been no recent information received
              from the neighbor.  On NBMA networks, Hello packets may
              still be sent to "Down" neighbors, although at a reduced
              frequency (see Section 9.5.1).
