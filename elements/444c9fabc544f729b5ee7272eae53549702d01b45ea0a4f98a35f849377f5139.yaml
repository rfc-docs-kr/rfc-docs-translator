                  according to the Section 12.4.3's algorithm, or can
                  choose to originate only a subset of the summary-LSAs,
                  possibly under configuration control.  The fewer LSAs
                  originated, the smaller the stub area's link state
                  database, further reducing the demands on its routers'
                  resources. However, omitting LSAs may also lead to sub-
                  optimal inter-area routing, although routing will
                  continue to function.
