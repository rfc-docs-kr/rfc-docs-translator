     Whether the ASP is permanently removed from any AS is a function of
     configuration management.  In the case where the ASP previously used
     the Registration procedures (see Section 4.4.1) to register within
     Application Servers but has not deregistered from all of them prior
     to sending the ASP Down message, the SGP MUST consider the ASP
     Deregistered in all Application Servers that it is still a member.
