              The normal TCP close sequence delivers buffered data
              reliably in both directions.  Since the two directions of a
              TCP connection are closed independently, it is possible for
              a connection to be "half closed," i.e., closed in only one
              direction, and a host is permitted to continue sending data
              in the open direction on a half-closed connection.
