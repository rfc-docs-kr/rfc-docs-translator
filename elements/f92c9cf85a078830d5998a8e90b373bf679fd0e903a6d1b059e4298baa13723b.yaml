     The FTP protocol insists that a USER command be used to identify the
     entity attempting to use the ftp server.  Although the TLS
     negotiation may be providing authentication information, the USER
     command MUST still be issued by the client.  However, it will be a
     server implementation issue to decide which credentials to accept and
     what consistency checks to make between the client cert used and the
     parameter on the USER command.
