     The Result-Code AVP (AVP Code 268) is of type Unsigned32 and
     indicates whether a particular request was completed successfully or
     an error occurred.  All Diameter answer messages in IETF-defined
     Diameter application specifications MUST include one Result-Code AVP.
     A non-successful Result-Code AVP (one containing a non-2xxx value
     other than DIAMETER_REDIRECT_INDICATION) MUST include the Error-
     Reporting-Host AVP if the host setting the Result-Code AVP is
     different from the identity encoded in the Origin-Host AVP.
