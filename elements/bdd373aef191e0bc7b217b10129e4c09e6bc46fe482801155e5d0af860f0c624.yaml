                   The dead-gateway detection mechanism must not cause
                   unacceptable load on the host, on connected networks,
                   or on first-hop gateway(s).  The exact constraints on
                   the timeliness of dead gateway detection and on
                   acceptable load may vary somewhat depending on the
                   nature of the host's mission, but a host generally
                   needs to detect a failed first-hop gateway quickly
                   enough that transport-layer connections will not break
                   before an alternate gateway can be selected.
