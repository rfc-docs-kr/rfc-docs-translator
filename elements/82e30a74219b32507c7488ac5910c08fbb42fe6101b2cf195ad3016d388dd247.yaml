     Where an Acct-Session-Id or Acct-Multi-Session-Id Attribute is not
     present in a CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request, it is possible that
     the User-Name or Chargeable-User-Identity attributes will not be
     sufficient to uniquely identify a single session (e.g., if the same
     user has multiple sessions on the NAS, or if the privacy NAI is
     used).  In this case, if it is desired to identify a single session,
     session identification MAY be performed by using one or more of the
     Framed-IP-Address, Framed-IPv6-Prefix/Framed-Interface-Id, Called-
     Station-Id, Calling-Station-Id, NAS-Port, and NAS-Port-Id attributes.
