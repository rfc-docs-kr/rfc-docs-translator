              (ii)  Update the local CRL cache with a current complete
                    CRL, verify that the current time is before the next
                    update value in the new CRL, and continue processing
                    with the new CRL.  If use-deltas is set and either the
                    certificate or the CRL contains the freshest CRL
                    extension, then obtain the current delta CRL that can
                    be used to update the new locally cached complete CRL
                    as specified in Section 5.2.4.
