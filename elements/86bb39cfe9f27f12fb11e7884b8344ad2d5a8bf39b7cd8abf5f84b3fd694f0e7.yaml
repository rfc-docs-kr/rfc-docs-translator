     Some protocols may have unique per-invocation inputs that are not 96
     bits in length.  For example, IPsec may specify a 64-bit nonce.  In
     such a case, it is up to the protocol document to define how to
     transform the protocol nonce into a 96-bit nonce, for example, by
     concatenating a constant value.
