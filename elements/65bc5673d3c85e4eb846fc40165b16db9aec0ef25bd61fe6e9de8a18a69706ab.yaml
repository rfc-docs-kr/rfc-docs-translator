     One possible technique that could allow for providing access control
     to heterogeneous groups and still allow for a single encrypted object
     representation that remains cacheable is Attribute-Based Encryption
     (ABE).  A first proposal for this is presented in [Ion13].  To
     support heterogeneous groups and avoid having a single authority that
     has a master key multi-authority, ABE can be used [Lewko11].
