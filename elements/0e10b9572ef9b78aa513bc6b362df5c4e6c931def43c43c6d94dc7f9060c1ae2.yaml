        Whichever method is used to ease address transition, the goal is
        that knowledge relating XYZ to its old address that is held
        throughout the global internet would eventually be replaced with
        the new information.  It is reasonable to expect this to take
        weeks or months and will be accomplished through the distributed
        directory system.  Discussion of the directory, along with other
        address transition techniques such as automatically informing the
        source of a changed address, are outside the scope of this paper.
