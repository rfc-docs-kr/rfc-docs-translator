        (f)  policy_mapping:  an integer that indicates if policy mapping
             is permitted.  The integer indicates the number of non-self-
             issued certificates to be processed before policy mapping is
             inhibited.  Once set, this variable may be decreased, but may
             not be increased.  That is, if a certificate in the path
             specifies that policy mapping is not permitted, it cannot be
             overridden by a later certificate.  If initial-policy-
             mapping-inhibit is set, then the initial value is 0,
             otherwise the initial value is n+1.
