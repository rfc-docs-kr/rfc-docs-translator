           Problem diagnosis will be aided if host implementations include
           a carefully designed facility for logging erroneous or
           "strange" protocol events.  It is important to include as much
           diagnostic information as possible when an error is logged.  In
           particular, it is often useful to record the header(s) of a
           packet that caused an error.  However, care must be taken to
           ensure that error logging does not consume prohibitive amounts
           of resources or otherwise interfere with the operation of the
           host.
