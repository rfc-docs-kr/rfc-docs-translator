"original": "Ford Aerospace and Communications  Corporation,  and  its  parent\ncompany,\
  \  Ford  Motor  Company,  operate  the only private IP/TCP\nlong-haul network in\
  \ existence today.  This network connects four\nfacilities  (one  in Michigan, two\
  \ in California, and one in Eng-\nland) some with extensive local networks.  This\
  \ net is cross-tied\nto  the  ARPANET  but  uses  its  own long-haul circuits; traffic\n\
  between Ford  facilities  flows  over  private  leased  circuits,\nincluding  a\
  \  leased  transatlantic  satellite  connection.   All\nswitching nodes are pure\
  \ IP datagram switches  with  no  node-to-\nnode  flow  control, and all hosts run\
  \ software either written or\nheavily modified by Ford or Ford Aerospace.  Bandwidth\
  \  of  links\nin  this  network varies widely, from 1200 to 10,000,000 bits per\n\
  second.  In general, we have not been able to afford  the  luxury\nof excess long-haul\
  \ bandwidth that the ARPANET possesses, and our\nlong-haul links are heavily loaded\
  \ during peak periods.   Transit\ntimes of several seconds are thus common in our\
  \ network.\n\f\nRFC 896    Congestion Control in IP/TCP Internetworks      1/6/84"
