              A system MUST NOT send an Address Mask Reply unless it is an
              authoritative agent for address masks.  An authoritative
              agent may be a host or a gateway, but it MUST be explicitly
              configured as a address mask agent.  Receiving an address
              mask via an Address Mask Reply does not give the receiver
              authority and MUST NOT be used as the basis for issuing
              Address Mask Replies.
