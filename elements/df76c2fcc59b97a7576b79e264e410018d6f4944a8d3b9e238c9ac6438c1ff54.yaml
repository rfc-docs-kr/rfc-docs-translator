     In encrypted mode, the first six blocks (96 octets) are encrypted
     using AES-CBC mode.  The AES Session-key to use is obtained in the
     same way as the key for authenticated mode.  Each TWAMP-Test packet
     is encrypted as a separate stream, with just one chaining operation;
     chaining does not span multiple packets so that lost, duplicated, or
     reordered packets do not cause problems.  The initialization vector
     for the CBC encryption is a value with all bits equal to zero.
