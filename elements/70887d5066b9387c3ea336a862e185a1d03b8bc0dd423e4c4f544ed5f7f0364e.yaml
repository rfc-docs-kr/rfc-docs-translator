     o  Added clarification that support for a Service-Type Attribute with
        value "Authorize Only" is optional on both the NAS and Dynamic
        Authorization Client (Section 3.2).  Use of the Service-Type
        Attribute within a Disconnect-Request is prohibited (Sections 3.2,
        3.6).
