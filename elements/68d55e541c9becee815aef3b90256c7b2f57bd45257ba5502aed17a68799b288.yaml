     Other MIB modules may define similar filters in the same way.  For
     example, a filter for Ethernet information might define source and
     destination MAC addresses of "any", Ethernet Packet Type, IEEE 802.2
     SAPs, and IEEE 802.1 priorities.  A filter related to policy routing
     might be structured like the diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, but contain
     the BGP Communities of the source and destination prefix rather than
     the prefix itself, meaning "any prefix in this community".  For such
     a filter, a table similar to diffServMultiFieldClfrTable is
     constructed, and diffServClfrElementSpecific is configured to point
     to it.
