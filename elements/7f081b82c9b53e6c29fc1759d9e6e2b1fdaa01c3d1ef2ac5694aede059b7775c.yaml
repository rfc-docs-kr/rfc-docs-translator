     The use of precomputed responses allows replay attacks in which an
     old (good) response is replayed prior to its expiration date but
     after the certificate has been revoked.  Deployments of OCSP should
     carefully evaluate the benefit of precomputed responses against the
     probability of a replay attack and the costs associated with its
     successful execution.
