     The example below shows an example of one way to accomplish a call-
     waiting scenario in a decomposed access gateway, illustrating the
     relocation of a Termination between Contexts.  Terminations T1 and T2
     belong to Context C1 in a two-way audio call.  A second audio call is
     waiting for T1 from Termination T3.  T3 is alone in Context C2.  T1
     accepts the call from T3, placing T2 on hold.  This action results in
     T1 moving into Context C2, as shown below.
