          Using this authentication type, a shared secret key is
          configured in all routers attached to a common network/subnet.
          For each OSPF protocol packet, the key is used to
          generate/verify a "message digest" that is appended to the end
          of the OSPF packet. The message digest is a one-way function of
          the OSPF protocol packet and the secret key. Since the secret
          key is never sent over the network in the clear, protection is
          provided against passive attacks.
