          The reasoning behind sending the above packets as multicasts is
          best explained by an example.  Consider the network
          configuration depicted in Figure 15.  Suppose RT4 has been
          elected as Designated Router, and RT3 as Backup Designated
          Router for the network N3.  When Router RT4 floods a new LSA to
          Network N3, it is received by routers RT1, RT2, and RT3.  These
          routers will not flood the LSA back onto net N3, but they still
          must ensure that their link-state databases remain synchronized
          with their adjacent neighbors.  So RT1, RT2, and RT4 are waiting
          to see an acknowledgment from RT3.  Likewise, RT4 and RT3 are
          both waiting to see acknowledgments from RT1 and RT2.  This is
          best achieved by sending the acknowledgments as multicasts.
