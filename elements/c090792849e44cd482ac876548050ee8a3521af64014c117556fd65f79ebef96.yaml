        The Mask parameter is an integer representing a bit mask that can
        be applied to the related Affected PC field.  The bit mask
        identifies how many bits of the Affected PC field are significant
        and which are effectively "wildcarded".  For example, a mask of
        "8" indicates that the last eight bits of the PC are "wildcarded".
        For an ANSI 24-bit Affected PC, this is equivalent to signalling
        that all PCs in an ANSI Cluster are unavailable.  A mask of "3"
        indicates that the last three bits of the PC are "wildcarded".
        For a 14-bit ITU Affected PC, this is equivalent to signaling that
        an ITU Region is unavailable.  A mask value equal (or greater
        than) the number of bits in the PC indicates that the entire
        network appearance is affected; this is used to indicate network
        isolation to the ASP.
