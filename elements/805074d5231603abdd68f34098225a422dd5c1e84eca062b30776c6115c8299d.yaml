     While Section 4 of the DHCP specification [RFC2131] assumes that DHCP
     servers save their leases in persistent storage, almost no consumer-
     grade NAT gateway does so.  Short DHCP lease lifetimes can mitigate
     this risk, though this also limits the operable candidate
     configurations available for DNAv4 to try.
