     Due to differences in handling change-of-authorization requests in
     RADIUS and Diameter, it may be difficult or impossible for a
     Diameter/RADIUS gateway to successfully translate a Diameter
     Re-Auth-Request (RAR) to a CoA-Request and vice versa.  For example,
     since a CoA-Request only initiates an authorization change but does
     not initiate re-authentication, a RAR command containing a
     Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP with value "AUTHORIZE_AUTHENTICATE" cannot
     be directly translated to a CoA-Request.  A Diameter/RADIUS gateway
     receiving a CoA-Request containing authorization changes will need to
     translate this into two Diameter exchanges.  First, the
     Diameter/RADIUS gateway will issue a RAR command including a
     Session-Id AVP and a Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP with value "AUTHORIZE
     ONLY".  Then the Diameter/RADIUS gateway will respond to the ensuing
     access request with a response including the authorization attributes
     gleaned from the CoA-Request.  To enable translation, the CoA-Request
     SHOULD include a Acct-Session-Id Attribute.  If the Diameter client
     uses the same Session-Id for both authorization and accounting, then
     the Diameter/RADIUS gateway can copy the contents of the Acct-
     Session-Id Attribute into the Session-Id AVP;  otherwise, it will
     need to map the Acct-Session-Id value to an equivalent Session-Id for
     use within a RAR command.
