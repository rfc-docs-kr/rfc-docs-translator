         EAP is a lock-step protocol, which implies a certain inefficiency
         when handling fragmentation and reassembly.  Therefore, if the
         lower layer supports fragmentation and reassembly (such as where
         EAP is transported over IP), it may be preferable for
         fragmentation and reassembly to occur in the lower layer rather
         than in EAP.  This can be accomplished by providing an
         artificially large EAP MTU to EAP, causing fragmentation and
         reassembly to be handled within the lower layer.
