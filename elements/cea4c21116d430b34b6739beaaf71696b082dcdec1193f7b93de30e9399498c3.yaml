     When the quantization tables are sent in-band, they need not be sent
     with every frame.  Like the out of band case, frames which do not
     contain tables will have a Quantization Table header with a Length
     field of 0.  While this does decrease the overhead of including the
     tables, new receivers will be unable to properly decode frames from
     the time they start up until they receive the tables.
