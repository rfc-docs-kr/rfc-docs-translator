          o   If the neighbor is both declaring itself to be Designated
              Router (Hello Packet's Designated Router field = Neighbor IP
              address) and the Backup Designated Router field in the
              packet is equal to 0.0.0.0 and the receiving interface is in
              state Waiting, the receiving interface's state machine is
              scheduled with the event BackupSeen.  Otherwise, if the
              neighbor is declaring itself to be Designated Router and it
              had not previously, or the neighbor is not declaring itself
              Designated Router where it had previously, the receiving
              interface's state machine is scheduled with the event
              NeighborChange.
