         *  Long (weeks to months): Expanding network capacity by adding
            new equipment, routers, and links takes time and is
            comparatively costly.  Capacity planning needs to take this
            into consideration.  Network capacity is expanded based on
            estimates or forecasts of future traffic development and
            traffic distribution.  These upgrades are typically carried
            out over weeks, months, or maybe even years.
