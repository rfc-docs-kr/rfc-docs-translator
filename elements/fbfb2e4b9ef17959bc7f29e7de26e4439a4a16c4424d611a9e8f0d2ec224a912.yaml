     send window
             This represents the sequence numbers that the remote
             (receiving) TCP endpoint is willing to receive.  It is the
             value of the window field specified in segments from the
             remote (data-receiving) TCP endpoint.  The range of new
             sequence numbers that may be emitted by a TCP implementation
             lies between SND.NXT and SND.UNA + SND.WND - 1.
             (Retransmissions of sequence numbers between SND.UNA and
             SND.NXT are expected, of course.)
