     Peer protocol entities are expected to keep in memory a list of the
     responses that they sent to recent transactions and a list of the
     transactions that are currently outstanding. The transaction
     identifier of each incoming message is compared to the transaction
     identifiers of the recent responses sent to the same MId. If a match
     is found, the entity does not execute the transaction, but simply
     repeats the response. If no match is found, the message will be
     compared to the list of currently outstanding transactions. If a
     match is found in that list, indicating a duplicate transaction, the
     entity does not execute the transaction (see section D.1.4 for
     procedures on sending TransactionPending).
