     It has become clear that the first two of these problems are likely
     to become critical in the near term.  Classless Inter-Domain Routing
     (CIDR) ttempts to deal with these problems by defining a mechanism to
     slow the growth of routing tables and reduce the need to allocate new
     IP network numbers.  It does not attempt to solve the third problem,
     which is of a more long-term nature, but instead endeavors to ease
     enough of the short to mid-term difficulties to allow the Internet to
     continue to function efficiently while progress is made on a longer-
     term solution.
