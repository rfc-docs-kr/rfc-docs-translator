        (d)  key pair recovery:  As an option, user client key materials
             (e.g., a user's private key used for encryption purposes) may
             be backed up by a CA or a key backup system.  If a user needs
             to recover these backed-up key materials (e.g., as a result
             of a forgotten password or a lost key chain file), an on-line
             protocol exchange may be needed to support such recovery.
