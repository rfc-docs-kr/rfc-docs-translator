     An informal analysis of "network-contacts.txt" (available from the
     DDN NIC) indicates that as of 2/25/92, 46 of 126 class A network
     numbers have been allocated (leaving 81) and 5467 of 16382 class B
     numbers have been allocated, leaving 10915. Assuming that recent
     trends continue, the number of allocated class B's will continue to
     double approximately once a year.  At this rate of growth, all class
     B's will be exhausted within about 15 months.  As of 1/13/93, 52
     class A network numbers have been allocated and 7133 class B's have
     been allocated.  We suggest that the change in the class B allocation
     rate is due to the initial deployment of this address allocation
     plan.
