            This policy aims to prevent a misbehaving subscriber from
            mounting several DS-Lite softwires that would consume
            additional AFTR resources (e.g., get more external ports if
            the quota were enforced on a per-softwire basis, consume extra
            processing due to a large number of active softwires).
