        The One-Time Password system is defined in "A One-Time Password
        System" [RFC2289] and "OTP Extended Responses" [RFC2243].  The
        Request contains an OTP challenge in the format described in
        [RFC2289].  A Response MUST be sent in reply to the Request.  The
        Response MUST be of Type 5 (OTP), Nak (Type 3), or Expanded Nak
        (Type 254).  The Nak Response indicates the peer's desired
        authentication Type(s).  The EAP OTP method is intended for use
        with the One-Time Password system only, and MUST NOT be used to
        provide support for cleartext passwords.
