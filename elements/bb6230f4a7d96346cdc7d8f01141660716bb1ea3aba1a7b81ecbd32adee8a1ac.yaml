         It was clear that then-current rates of Internet growth would
         cause the first two problems to become critical sometime between
         1993 and 1995.  Work already in progress on topological
         assignment of addressing for Connectionless Network Service
         (CLNS), which was presented to the community at the Boulder IETF
         in December of 1990, led to thoughts on how to re-structure the
         32-bit IPv4 address space to increase its lifespan.  Work in the
         ROAD group followed and eventually resulted in the publication of
         [RFC1338], and later, [RFC1519].
