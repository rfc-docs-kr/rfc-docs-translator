     To detect loops in the SRH, a router MUST determine if the SRH
     includes multiple addresses assigned to any interface on that router.
     If such addresses appear more than once and are separated by at least
     one address not assigned to that router, the router MUST drop the
     packet and SHOULD send an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, to the
     Source Address.  While this loop check does add significant per-
     packet processing overhead, it is required to mitigate bandwidth
     exhaustion attacks that led to the deprecation of RH0 [RFC5095].
