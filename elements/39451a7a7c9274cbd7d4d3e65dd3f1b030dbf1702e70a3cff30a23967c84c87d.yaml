      Router-LSAs are the Type 1 LSAs.  Each router in an area originates
      a router-LSA.  The LSA describes the state and cost of the router's
      links (i.e., interfaces) to the area.  All of the router's links to
      the area must be described in a single router-LSA.  For details
      concerning the construction of router-LSAs, see Section 12.4.1.
