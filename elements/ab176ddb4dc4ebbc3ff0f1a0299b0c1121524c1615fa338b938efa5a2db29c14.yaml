     Where a Diameter client utilizes the same Session-Id for both
     authorization and accounting, inclusion of an Acct-Session-Id
     Attribute in a Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request can assist with
     Diameter/RADIUS translation, since Diameter RAR and ASR commands
     include a Session-Id AVP.  An Acct-Session-Id Attribute SHOULD be
     included in Disconnect-Request and CoA-Request packets.
