     An AS becomes AS-ACTIVE right after n ASPs reach the ASP-ACTIVE state
     during the startup phase (except for smooth start).  Once the traffic
     is flowing, an AS keeps the AS-ACTIVE state till the last ASP turns
     to another state different from ASP-ACTIVE, avoiding unnecessary
     traffic disturbances as long as there are ASPs available (this
     assumes that the system will not always be exposed to the maximum
     load).
