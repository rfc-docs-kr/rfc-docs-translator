     Nine hash functions are given as examples for the encoding methods in
     this document: MD2 [RFC1319] (which was retired by [RFC6149]), MD5
     [RFC1321], SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224,
     and SHA-512/256 [SHS].  For the RSAES-OAEP encryption scheme and
     EMSA-PSS encoding method, only SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-
     512, SHA-512/224, and SHA-512/256 are RECOMMENDED.  For the EMSA-
     PKCS1-v1_5 encoding method, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-
     512/224, and SHA-512/256 are RECOMMENDED for new applications.  MD2,
     MD5, and SHA-1 are recommended only for compatibility with existing
     applications based on PKCS #1 v1.5.

  이 문서의 인코딩 방법에 대한 예로 MD2 [RFC1319]([RFC6149]에 의해 폐기됨), MD5 [RFC1321], SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 및 SHA-512/256 [SHS]. RSAES-OAEP 암호화 방식 및 EMSA-PSS 인코딩 방법의 경우 SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 및 SHA-512/256만 권장됩니다. EMSA-PKCS1-v1_5 인코딩 방법의 경우 SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224 및 SHA-512/256이 새 애플리케이션에 권장됩니다. MD2, MD5 및 SHA-1은 PKCS #1 v1.5를 기반으로 하는 기존 애플리케이션과의 호환성을 위해서만 권장됩니다.
