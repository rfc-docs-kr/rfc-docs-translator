     In Section 4.1.2.1 of [RFC5245], a recommended formula for UDP ICE
     candidate prioritization is defined.  For TCP candidates, the same
     formula and candidate type preferences SHOULD be used, and the
     RECOMMENDED type preferences for the new candidate types defined in
     this document (see Section 5) are 105 for NAT-assisted candidates and
     75 for UDP-tunneled candidates.
