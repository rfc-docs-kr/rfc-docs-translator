     In the MIB module, diffServRandomDropMinThreshBytes and
     diffServRandomDropMinThreshPkts represent Qmin.
     diffServRandomDropMaxThreshBytes and diffServRandomDropMaxThreshPkts
     represent Qmax.  diffServAlgDropQThreshold represents Qclip.
     diffServRandomDropInvProbMax represents Pmax (inverse).  This MIB
     does not represent Pmin (assumed to be zero unless otherwise
     represented).  In addition, since message memory is finite, queues
     generally have some upper bound above which they are incapable of
     storing additional traffic.  Normally this number is equal to Qclip,
     specified by diffServAlgDropQThreshold.
