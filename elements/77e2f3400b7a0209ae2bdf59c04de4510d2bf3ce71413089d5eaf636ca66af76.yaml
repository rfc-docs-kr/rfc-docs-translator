          Premature aging is used when it is time for a self-originated
          LSA's sequence number field to wrap.  At this point, the current
          LSA instance (having LS sequence number MaxSequenceNumber) must
          be prematurely aged and flushed from the routing domain before a
          new instance with sequence number equal to InitialSequenceNumber
          can be originated.  See Section 12.1.6 for more information.
