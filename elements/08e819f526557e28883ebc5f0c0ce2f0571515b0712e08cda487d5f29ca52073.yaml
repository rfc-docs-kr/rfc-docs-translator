     For Q values from 128 to 254, the Q value to quantization table data
     mapping MUST be static, i.e., the receivers are guaranteed that they
     only need to read the table data once in order to correctly decode
     frames sent with that Q value.  A Q value of 255 denotes that the
     quantization table mapping is dynamic and can change on every frame.
     Decoders MUST NOT depend on any previous version of the tables, and
     need to reload these tables on every frame.  Packets MUST NOT contain
     Q = 255 and Length = 0.
