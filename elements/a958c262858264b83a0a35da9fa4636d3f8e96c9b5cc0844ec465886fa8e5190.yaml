          If the packet type is Hello, it should then be further processed
          by the Hello Protocol (see Section 10.5).  All other packet
          types are sent/received only on adjacencies.  This means that
          the packet must have been sent by one of the router's active
          neighbors.  If the receiving interface connects to a broadcast
          network, Point-to-MultiPoint network or NBMA network the sender
          is identified by the IP source address found in the packet's IP
          header.  If the receiving interface connects to a point-to-point
          network or a virtual link, the sender is identified by the
          Router ID (source router) found in the packet's OSPF header.
          The data structure associated with the receiving interface
          contains the list of active neighbors.  Packets not matching any
          active neighbor are discarded.
