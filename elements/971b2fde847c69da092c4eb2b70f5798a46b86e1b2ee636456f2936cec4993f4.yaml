          (4) Look up the routing table entry for the advertising router
              BR associated with the Area A. If it is unreachable, examine
              the next LSA. Otherwise, the cost to destination N is the
              sum of the cost in BR's Area A routing table entry and the
              cost advertised in the LSA. Call this cost IAC.
