              (b) Otherwise, W is a transit vertex (router or transit
                  network).  Look up the vertex W's LSA (router-LSA or
                  network-LSA) in Area A's link state database.  If the
                  LSA does not exist, or its LS age is equal to MaxAge, or
                  it does not have a link back to vertex V, examine the
                  next link in V's LSA.[23]
