     Finally, it should be noted that implementing various techniques
     listed in Section 5 should increase the success probability, but many
     of these techniques require support from the endpoints and/or from
     some network elements (e.g., from the NATs).  Without comprehensive
     experimental data on how well different techniques are supported, the
     actual increase of success probability is hard to evaluate.
