   Example: If the block length is 8 bytes, the content length
            (TLSCompressed.length) is 61 bytes, and the MAC length is 20
            bytes, the length before padding is 82 bytes. Thus, the
            padding length modulo 8 must be equal to 6 in order to make
            the total length an even multiple of 8 bytes (the block
            length). The padding length can be 6, 14, 22, and so on,
            through 254. If the padding length were the minimum necessary,
            6, the padding would be 6 bytes, each containing the value 6.
            Thus, the last 8 octets of the GenericBlockCipher before block
            encryption would be xx 06 06 06 06 06 06 06, where xx is the
            last octet of the MAC.
