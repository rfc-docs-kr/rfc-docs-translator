          Lower-level protocol support
              The lower level protocols referred to here are the network
              access protocols, such as the Ethernet data link layer.
              Indications must be passed from these protocols to OSPF as
              the network interface goes up and down.  For example, on an
              ethernet it would be valuable to know when the ethernet
              transceiver cable becomes unplugged.
