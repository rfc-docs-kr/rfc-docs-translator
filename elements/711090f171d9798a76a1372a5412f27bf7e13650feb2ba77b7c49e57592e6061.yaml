     Diameter proxies MUST support the base protocol, which includes
     accounting.  In addition, they MUST fully support each Diameter
     application that is needed to implement proxied services, e.g.,
     NASREQ and/or Mobile IPv4.  A Diameter proxy MUST be referred to as
     "Diameter X Proxy" where X is the application which it supports, and
     not a "Diameter Proxy".
