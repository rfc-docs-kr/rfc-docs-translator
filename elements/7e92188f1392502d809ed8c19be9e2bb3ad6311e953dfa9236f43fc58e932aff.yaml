      OSPF does not define a way to fragment its protocol packets, and
      depends on IP fragmentation when transmitting packets larger than
      the network MTU. If necessary, the length of OSPF packets can be up
      to 65,535 bytes (including the IP header).  The OSPF packet types
      that are likely to be large (Database Description Packets, Link
      State Request, Link State Update, and Link State Acknowledgment
      packets) can usually be split into several separate protocol
      packets, without loss of functionality.  This is recommended; IP
      fragmentation should be avoided whenever possible.  Using this
      reasoning, an attempt should be made to limit the sizes of OSPF
      packets sent over virtual links to 576 bytes unless Path MTU
      Discovery is being performed (see [Ref22]).
