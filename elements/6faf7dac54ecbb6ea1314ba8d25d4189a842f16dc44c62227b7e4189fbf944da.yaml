     Existing implementations of this protocol do not support
     authorization checks, so that an ISP sharing a NAS with another ISP
     could disconnect or change authorizations for another ISP's users.
     In order to remedy this problem, a "Reverse Path Forwarding" check is
     described; see Section 6.1 for details.
