      List of AS-external-LSAs
          Part of the link-state database.  These have originated from the
          AS boundary routers.  They comprise routes to destinations
          external to the Autonomous System.  Note that, if the router is
          itself an AS boundary router, some of these AS-external-LSAs
          have been self-originated.
