          The graph in Figure 13 shows the forming of an adjacency.  Not
          every two neighboring routers become adjacent (see Section
          10.4).  The adjacency starts to form when the neighbor is in
          state ExStart.  After the two routers discover their
          master/slave status, the state transitions to Exchange.  At this
          point the neighbor starts to be used in the flooding procedure,
          and the two neighboring routers begin synchronizing their
          databases.  When this synchronization is finished, the neighbor
          is in state Full and we say that the two routers are fully
          adjacent.  At this point the adjacency is listed in LSAs.
