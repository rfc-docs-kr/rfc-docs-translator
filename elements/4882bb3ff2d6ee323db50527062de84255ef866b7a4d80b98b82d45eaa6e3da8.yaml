     NETCONF defines the existence of one or more configuration datastores
     and allows configuration operations on them.  A configuration
     datastore is defined as the complete set of configuration data that
     is required to get a device from its initial default state into a
     desired operational state.  The configuration datastore does not
     include state data or executive commands.
