              DISCUSSION:
                   TCP reserves port numbers in the range 0-255 for
                   "well-known" ports, used to access services that are
                   standardized across the Internet.  The remainder of the
                   port space can be freely allocated to application
                   processes.  Current well-known port definitions are
                   listed in the RFC entitled "Assigned Numbers"
                   [INTRO:6].  A prerequisite for defining a new well-
                   known port is an RFC documenting the proposed service
                   in enough detail to allow new implementations.
