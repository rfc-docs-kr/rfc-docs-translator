                   (4)  Higher-layer Advice -- Provide a call from the
                        Internet layer to the link layer to indicate a
                        delivery problem.  The effect of this call would
                        be to invalidate the corresponding cache entry.
                        This call would be analogous to the
                        "ADVISE_DELIVPROB()" call from the transport layer
                        to the Internet layer (see Section 3.4), and in
                        fact the ADVISE_DELIVPROB routine might in turn
                        call the link-layer advice routine to invalidate
