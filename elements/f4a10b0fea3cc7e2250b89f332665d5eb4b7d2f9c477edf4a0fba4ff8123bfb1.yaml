     Compared to UDP-based ICE, ICE TCP has, in general, lower success
     probability for enabling connectivity without a relay if both of the
     hosts are behind a NAT.  This happens because many of the currently
     deployed NATs have endpoint-dependent mapping behavior, or they do
     not support the flow of TCP handshake packets seen in the case of TCP
     simultaneous-open, e.g., some NATs do not allow incoming TCP SYN
     packets from an address where a SYN packet has been sent to recently
     or the subsequent SYN-ACK is not processed properly.
