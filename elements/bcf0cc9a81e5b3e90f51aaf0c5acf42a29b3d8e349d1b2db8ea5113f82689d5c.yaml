     The State Attribute is also available to be sent by the Dynamic
     Authorization Client to the NAS in a CoA-Request that also includes a
     Termination-Action Attribute with the value of RADIUS-Request.  If
     the NAS performs the Termination-Action by sending a new Access-
     Request upon termination of the current session, it MUST include the
     State Attribute unchanged in that Access-Request.  In either usage,
     the Dynamic Authorization Server MUST NOT interpret the Attribute
     locally.  A CoA-Request packet MUST have only zero or one State
     Attribute.  Usage of the State Attribute is implementation dependent.
