          RxmtInterval
              The number of seconds between LSA retransmissions, for
              adjacencies belonging to this interface.  Also used when
              retransmitting Database Description and Link State Request
              Packets.  This should be well over the expected round-trip
              delay between any two routers on the attached network.  The
              setting of this value should be conservative or needless
              retransmissions will result.  Sample value for a local area
              network: 5 seconds.
