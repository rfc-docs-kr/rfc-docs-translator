     The TWAMP-Test protocol is similar to the OWAMP-test protocol
     [RFC4656] with the exception that the Session-Reflector transmits
     test packets to the Session-Sender in response to each test packet it
     receives.  TWAMP defines two different test packet formats, one for
     packets transmitted by the Session-Sender and one for packets
     transmitted by the Session-Reflector.  As with OWAMP-test protocol
     [RFC4656], there are three modes: unauthenticated, authenticated, and
     encrypted.
