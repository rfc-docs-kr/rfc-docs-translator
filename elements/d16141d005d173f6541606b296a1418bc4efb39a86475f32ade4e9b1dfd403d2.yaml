        Rationale: SSLv3 [RFC6101] was an improvement over SSLv2 and
        plugged some significant security holes but did not support strong
        cipher suites.  SSLv3 does not support TLS extensions, some of
        which (e.g., renegotiation_info [RFC5746]) are security-critical.
        In addition, with the emergence of the POODLE attack [POODLE],
        SSLv3 is now widely recognized as fundamentally insecure.  See
        [DEP-SSLv3] for further details.

  - 근거: SSLv3 [RFC6101]은 SSLv2보다 개선되었으며 몇 가지 중요한 보안 허점을 해결했지만 강력한 암호화 제품군을 지원하지 않았습니다. SSLv3은 TLS 확장을 지원하지 않으며 그 중 일부(예: renegotiation_info [RFC5746])는 보안에 중요합니다. 또한 POODLE 공격 [POODLE]이 등장하면서 SSLv3은 이제 근본적으로 안전하지 않은 것으로 널리 인식되었습니다. 자세한 내용은 [DEP-SSLv3]을 참조하세요.
