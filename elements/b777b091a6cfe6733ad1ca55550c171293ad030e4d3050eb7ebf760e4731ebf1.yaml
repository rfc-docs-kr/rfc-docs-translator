      The Link State ID in AS-external-LSAs and summary-LSAs is usually
      set to the described network's IP address. However, if necessary one
      or more of the network's host bits may be set in the Link State ID.
      This allows the router to originate separate LSAs for networks
      having the same address, yet different masks. Such networks can
      occur in the presence of supernetting and subnet 0s (see [Ref10]).
