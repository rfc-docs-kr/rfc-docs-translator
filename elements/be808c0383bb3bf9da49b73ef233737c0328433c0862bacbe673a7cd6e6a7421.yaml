     The home Diameter server, prior to authorizing a session, MUST check
     the Route-Record AVPs to make sure that the route traversed by the
     request is acceptable.  For example, administrators within the home
     realm may not wish to honor requests that have been routed through an
     untrusted realm.  By authorizing a request, the home Diameter server
     is implicitly indicating its willingness to engage in the business
     transaction as specified by any contractual relationship between the
     server and the previous hop.  A DIAMETER_AUTHORIZATION_REJECTED error
     message (see Section 7.1.5) is sent if the route traversed by the
     request is unacceptable.
