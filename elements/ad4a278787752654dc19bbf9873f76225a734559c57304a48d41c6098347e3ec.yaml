     Overall system metrics that need to be considered include
     reliability, scalability, energy efficiency, and delay/disconnection
     tolerance.  In deployments where ICN is addressing specific
     scenarios, relevant system metrics could be derived from current
     experience.  For example, in Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios,
     which are discussed in [RFC7476], it is reasonable to consider the
     current generation of sensor nodes, sources of information, and even
     measurement gateways (e.g., for smart metering at homes) or
     smartphones.  In this case, ICN operation ought to be evaluated with
     respect not only to overall scalability and network efficiency, but
