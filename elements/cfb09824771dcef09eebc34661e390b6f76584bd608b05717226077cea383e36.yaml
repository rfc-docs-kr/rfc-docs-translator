              +  If this connection was initiated with a passive OPEN
                 (i.e., came from the LISTEN state), then return this
                 connection to LISTEN state and return.  The user need not
                 be informed.  If this connection was initiated with an
                 active OPEN (i.e., came from SYN-SENT state), then the
                 connection was refused; signal the user "connection
                 refused".  In either case, the retransmission queue
                 should be flushed.  And in the active OPEN case, enter
                 the CLOSED state and delete the TCB, and return.
