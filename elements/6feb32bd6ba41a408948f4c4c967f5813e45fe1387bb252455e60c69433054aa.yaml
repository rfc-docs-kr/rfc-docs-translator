      An OSPF router converses with its neighboring routers.  Each
      separate conversation is described by a "neighbor data structure".
      Each conversation is bound to a particular OSPF router interface,
      and is identified either by the neighboring router's OSPF Router ID
      or by its Neighbor IP address (see below).  Thus if the OSPF router
      and another router have multiple attached networks in common,
      multiple conversations ensue, each described by a unique neighbor
      data structure.  Each separate conversation is loosely referred to
      in the text as being a separate "neighbor".
