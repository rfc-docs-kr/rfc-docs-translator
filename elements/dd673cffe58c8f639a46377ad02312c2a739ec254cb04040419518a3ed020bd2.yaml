          Simple password authentication guards against routers
          inadvertently joining the routing domain; each router must first
          be configured with its attached networks' passwords before it
          can participate in routing.  However, simple password
          authentication is vulnerable to passive attacks currently
          widespread in the Internet (see [Ref16]). Anyone with physical
          access to the network can learn the password and compromise the
          security of the OSPF routing domain.
