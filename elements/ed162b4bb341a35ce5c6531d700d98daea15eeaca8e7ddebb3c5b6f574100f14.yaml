     1.  Forwarding in the Internet is done on a longest-match basis.
         This implies that destinations that are multi-homed relative to a
         routing domain must always be explicitly announced into that
         routing domain (i.e., they cannot be summarized).  If a network
         is multi-homed, all of its paths into a routing domain that is
         "higher" in the hierarchy of networks must be known to the
         "higher" network).
