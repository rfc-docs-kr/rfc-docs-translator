     Once the network has been planned and the packets have been marked at
     the network edge, the Diffserv model deals with traffic management
     issues on a per-hop basis.  The Diffserv control model consists of a
     collection of micro-TE control mechanisms.  Other TE capabilities,
     such as capacity management (including routing control), are also
     required in order to deliver acceptable service quality in Diffserv
     networks.  The concept of "Per-Domain Behaviors" has been introduced
     to better capture the notion of Diffserv across a complete domain
     [RFC3086].

  네트워크가 계획되고 네트워크 에지에서 패킷이 표시되면 Diffserv 모델은 홉별로 트래픽 관리 문제를 처리합니다. Diffserv 제어 모델은 micro-TE 제어 메커니즘 모음으로 구성됩니다. Diffserv 네트워크에서 허용 가능한 서비스 품질을 제공하려면 용량 관리(라우팅 제어 포함)와 같은 기타 TE 기능도 필요합니다. 전체 도메인에 걸쳐 Diffserv의 개념을 더 잘 포착하기 위해 "도메인별 동작" 개념이 도입되었습니다[RFC3086].
