                   One reason for ACKing out-of-order segments might be to
                   support an experimental algorithm known as "fast
                   retransmit".   With this algorithm, the sender uses the
                   "redundant" ACK's to deduce that a segment has been
                   lost before the retransmission timer has expired.  It
                   counts the number of times an ACK has been received
                   with the same value of SEG.ACK and with the same right
                   window edge.  If more than a threshold number of such
                   ACK's is received, then the segment containing the
                   octets starting at SEG.ACK is assumed to have been lost
                   and is retransmitted, without awaiting a timeout.  The
                   threshold is chosen to compensate for the maximum
                   likely segment reordering in the Internet.  There is
                   not yet enough experience with the fast retransmit
                   algorithm to determine how useful it is.
