     *  Detailed guidance was published on the use of TLS 1.2 [RFC5246]
        and DTLS 1.2 [RFC6347] along with earlier protocol versions.  This
        guidance is included in the original [RFC7525] and mostly retained
        in this revised version; note that this guidance was mostly
        adopted by the industry since the publication of RFC 7525 in 2015.
