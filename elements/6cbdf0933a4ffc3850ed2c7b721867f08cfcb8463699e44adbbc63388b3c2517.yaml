      Neighbor Options
          The optional OSPF capabilities supported by the neighbor.
          Learned during the Database Exchange process (see Section 10.6).
          The neighbor's optional OSPF capabilities are also listed in its
          Hello packets.  This enables received Hello Packets to be
          rejected (i.e., neighbor relationships will not even start to
          form) if there is a mismatch in certain crucial OSPF
          capabilities (see Section 10.5).  The optional OSPF capabilities
          are documented in Section 4.5.
