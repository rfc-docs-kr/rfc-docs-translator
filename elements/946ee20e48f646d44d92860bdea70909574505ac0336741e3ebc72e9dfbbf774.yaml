        It has been about 5 years since the release of the Internet
        Protocol Transition Workbook (IPTW) and the related documents
        which were issued as a document set for implementors of TCP/IP and
        related application protocols.  These were issued to assist the
        NCP-to-TCP transition which took place in early 1983.  Since that
        time the network has undergone many changes, the most noteable
        being the creation of the Defense Data Network (DDN) and the
        ARPANET/MILNET split, leaving the ARPANET as a research and
        development network, and MILNET as an operational military
        network.

  - TCP/IP 및 관련 응용 프로토콜 구현자를 위한 문서세트로 발행된 IPTW(인터넷 프로토콜 전환 워크북) 및 관련 문서가 출시된 지 약 5년이 지났습니다. 이는 1983년 초에 발생한 NCP에서 TCP로의 전환을 지원하기 위해 발행되었습니다. 그 이후로 네트워크는 많은 변화를 겪었으며, 가장 주목할만한 것은 국방 데이터 네트워크(DDN)의 생성과 ARPANET/MILNET 분할입니다. ARPANET은 연구 개발 네트워크로, MILNET은 작전용 군사 네트워크로 남겨둡니다.
