        Tutorial: SKIP was designed by Ashar Aziz and Whitfield Diffie at
        Sun Microsystems and proposed as the standard key management
        protocol for IPsec, but IKE was chosen instead. Although IKE is
        mandatory for an IPsec implementation, the use of SKIP is not
        excluded.

  - 튜토리얼: SKIP은 Sun Microsystems의 Ashar Aziz와 Whitfield Diffie가 설계했으며 IPsec의 표준 키 관리 프로토콜로 제안되었지만 대신 IKE가 선택되었습니다. IPsec 구현에는 IKE가 필수이지만 SKIP 사용도 배제되지 않습니다.
