     Both the SMTP client and server must check the result of the TLS
     negotiation to see whether an acceptable degree of authentication and
     privacy was achieved.  Ignoring this step completely invalidates
     using TLS for security.  The decision about whether acceptable
     authentication or privacy was achieved is made locally, is
     implementation-dependent, and is beyond the scope of this document.
