        The discussions in Section 5.3 suggest methods for allocating IP
        addresses based on direct or indirect provider connectivity. This
        allows a great deal of information reduction to be achieved for
        those routing domains which are attached to a single TRD. In
        particular, such routing domains may select their IP addresses
        from a space delegated to them by the direct provider. This allows
        the provider, when announcing the addresses that it can reach to
        other providers, to use a single address prefix to describe a
        large number of IP addresses corresponding to multiple routing
