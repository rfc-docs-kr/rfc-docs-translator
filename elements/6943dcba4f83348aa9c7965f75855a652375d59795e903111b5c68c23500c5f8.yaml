     If the Diameter peer does not support receiving TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP
     connections on port 5658 (i.e., the peer complies only with RFC
     3588), then the initiator MAY revert to using TCP or SCTP on port
     3868.  Note that this scheme is kept only for the purpose of backward
     compatibility and that there are inherent security vulnerabilities
     when the initial CER/CEA messages are sent unprotected (see
     Section 5.6).
