     In many architectures IPSec does not require integration with SIP
     applications; IPSec is perhaps best suited to deployments in which
     adding security directly to SIP hosts would be arduous.  UAs that
     have a pre-shared keying relationship with their first-hop proxy
     server are also good candidates to use IPSec.  Any deployment of
     IPSec for SIP would require an IPSec profile describing the protocol
     tools that would be required to secure SIP.  No such profile is given
     in this document.

  많은 아키텍처에서 IPSec은 SIP 애플리케이션과의 통합을 요구하지 않습니다. IPSec는 아마도 SIP 호스트에 직접 보안을 추가하는 것이 어려운 배포에 가장 적합할 것입니다. 첫 번째 홉 프록시 서버와 사전 공유 키잉 관계가 있는 UA도 IPSec를 사용하기에 좋은 후보입니다. SIP용 IPSec 배포에는 SIP 보안에 필요한 프로토콜 도구를 설명하는 IPSec 프로필이 필요합니다. 이 문서에는 그러한 프로필이 제공되지 않습니다.
