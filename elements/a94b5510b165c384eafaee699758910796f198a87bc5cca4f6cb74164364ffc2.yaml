                  Consider the router-LSAs generated by Router RT3, as
                  pictured in Figure 6.  The area containing Router RT3
                  (Area 1) has been redrawn, with actual network
                  addresses, in Figure 15.  Assume that the last byte of
                  all of RT3's interface addresses is 3, giving it the
                  interface addresses 192.1.1.3 and 192.1.4.3, and that
                  the other routers have similar addressing schemes.  In
                  addition, assume that all links are functional, and that
                  Router IDs are assigned as the smallest IP interface
                  address.
