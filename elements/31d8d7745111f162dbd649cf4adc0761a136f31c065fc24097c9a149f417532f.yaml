     Sending a DHCPREQUEST to the unicast address in INIT-REBOOT state is
     not appropriate, since if the DHCP client has moved to another
     subnet, a DHCP server response cannot be routed back to the client
     since the DHCPREQUEST will bypass the DHCP relay and will contain an
     invalid source address.
