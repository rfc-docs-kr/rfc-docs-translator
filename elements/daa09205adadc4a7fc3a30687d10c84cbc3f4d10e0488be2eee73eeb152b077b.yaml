        However, it is important that zero-homed routing domains use valid
        globally unique IP addresses. Suppose that the zero-homed routing
        domain is connected through a private link to a routing domain.
        Further, this routing domain participates in an internet that
        subscribes to the global IP addressing plan. This domain must be
        able to distinguish between the zero-homed routing domain's IP
        addresses and any other IP addresses that it may need to route to.
        The only way this can be guaranteed is if the zero-homed routing
        domain uses globally unique IP addresses.
