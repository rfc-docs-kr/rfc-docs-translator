         One example of a filter table defined in this MIB is
         diffServMultiFieldClfrTable, for IP Multi-Field Classifiers
         (MFCs). Such an entry might identify anything from a single
         micro-flow (an identifiable sub-session packet stream directed
         from one sending transport to the receiving transport or
         transports), or aggregates of those such as the traffic from a
         host, traffic for an application, or traffic between two hosts
         using an application and a given DSCP. The standard Behavior
         Aggregate used in the Differentiated Services Architecture is
         encoded as a degenerate case of such an aggregate - the traffic
         using a particular DSCP value.
