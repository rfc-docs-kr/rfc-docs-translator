     [5] Possible duplication.  Where the lower layer is reliable, it will
         provide the EAP layer with a non-duplicated stream of packets.
         However,  while it is desirable that lower layers provide for
         non-duplication, this is not a requirement.  The Identifier field
         provides both the peer and authenticator with the ability to
         detect duplicates.
