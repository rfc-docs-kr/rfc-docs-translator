     Where a host has an operable routable IPv4 address on one or more
     networks but the reachability test cannot confirm the configuration
     and the DHCPv4 client does not receive a response after employing the
     retransmission algorithm, Section 3.2 of the DHCP specification
     [RFC2131] states that the client MAY choose to use the previously
     allocated network address and configuration parameters for the
     remainder of the unexpired lease.
