        While Diameter does not share a common protocol data unit (PDU)
        with RADIUS, considerable effort has been expended in enabling
        backward compatibility with RADIUS so that the two protocols may
        be deployed in the same network.  Initially, it is expected that
        Diameter will be deployed within new network devices, as well as
        within gateways enabling communication between legacy RADIUS
        devices and Diameter agents.  This capability enables Diameter
        support to be added to legacy networks, by addition of a gateway
        or server speaking both RADIUS and Diameter.
