     If routing domains are interconnected in a more-or-less random (i.e.,
     non-hierarchical) scheme, it is quite likely that no further
     abstraction of routing data can occur. Since routing domains would
     have no defined hierarchical relationship, administrators would not
     be able to assign IP addresses within the domains out of some common
     prefix for the purpose of data abstraction. The result would be flat
     inter-domain routing; all routing domains would need explicit
     knowledge of all other routing domains that they route to.  This can
     work well in small and medium sized internets.  However, this does
     not scale to very large internets.  For example, we expect growth in
     the future to an Internet which has tens or hundreds of thousands of
     routing domains in North America alone.  This requires a greater
     degree of the reachability information abstraction beyond that which
     can be achieved at the "routing domain" level.
