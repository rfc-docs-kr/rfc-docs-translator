     In the case of an Override mode AS, where another ASP has already
     taken over the traffic within the AS with an ASP Active ("Override")
     message, the ASP that sends the ASP Inactive message is already
     considered to be in ASP-INACTIVE state by the SGP.  An ASP Inactive
     Ack message is sent to the ASP, after ensuring that all traffic is
     stopped to the ASP.
