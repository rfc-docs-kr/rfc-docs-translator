         DESCRIPTION
                "Indicate the mask to be logical-ANDed with the
                 destination address before being compared to the value
                 in the ipCidrRouteDest field.  For those systems that
                 do not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent
                 constructs the value of the ipCidrRouteMask by
                 reference to the IP Address Class.
