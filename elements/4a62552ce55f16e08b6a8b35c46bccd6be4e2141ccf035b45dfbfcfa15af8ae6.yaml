          Two graphs are possible, depending on whether a Designated
          Router is elected for the network.  On physical point-to-point
          networks, Point-to-MultiPoint networks and virtual links,
          neighboring routers become adjacent whenever they can
          communicate directly.  In contrast, on broadcast and NBMA
          networks only the Designated Router and the Backup Designated
          Router become adjacent to all other routers attached to the
          network.
