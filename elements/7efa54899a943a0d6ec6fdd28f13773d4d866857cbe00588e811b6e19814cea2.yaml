     For example, a private network connected to a business partner
     through a VPN could employ traditional NAT to communicate with the
     partner. Likewise, it is possible to employ twice NAT, if the
     partner's address space overlapped with the private network.  There
     could be a NAT device on one end of the tunnel or on both ends of the
     tunnel. In all cases, traffic across the VPN can be encrypted for
     security purposes. Security here refers to security for traffic
     across VPNs alone. End-to-end security requires trusting NAT devices
     within private network.
