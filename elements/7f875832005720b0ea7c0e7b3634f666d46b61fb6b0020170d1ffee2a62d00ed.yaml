     Delegated credentials limit the exposure of the private key used in a
     (D)TLS connection by limiting its validity period.  An attacker who
     compromises the private key of a delegated credential cannot create
     new delegated credentials, but they can impersonate the compromised
     party in new TLS connections until the delegated credential expires.
