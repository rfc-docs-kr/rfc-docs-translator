     Note that while many protocols have provisions for a nonce for
     encryption algorithms (often called Initialization Vectors, or IVs),
     they usually don't have such a provision for the MAC function.  In
     that case, the per-invocation nonce will have to come from somewhere
     else, such as a message counter.
