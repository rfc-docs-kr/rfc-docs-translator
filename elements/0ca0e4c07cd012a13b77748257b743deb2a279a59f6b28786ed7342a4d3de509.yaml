     A successful PAUSE request for media being transported over RTP/AVP/
     TCP pauses the flow of packets over the connections, without closing
     the connections.  A successful TEARDOWN request signals that the TCP
     connections for RTP and RTCP are to be closed by the RTSP client as
     soon as possible.

  RTP/AVP/TCP를 통해 전송되는 미디어에 대한 성공적인 PAUSE 요청은 연결을 닫지 않고 연결을 통한 패킷 흐름을 일시 중지합니다. TEARDOWN 요청이 성공하면 RTSP 클라이언트가 RTP 및 RTCP에 대한 TCP 연결을 가능한 한 빨리 닫아야 한다는 신호를 보냅니다.
