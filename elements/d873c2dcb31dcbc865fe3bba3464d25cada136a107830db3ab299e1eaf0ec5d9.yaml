     Historically, port 465 was briefly registered as the "smtps" port.
     This registration made no sense, as the SMTP transport MX
     infrastructure has no way to specify a port, so port 25 is always
     used.  As a result, the registration was revoked and was subsequently
     reassigned to a different service.  In hindsight, the "smtps"
     registration should have been renamed or reserved rather than
     revoked.  Unfortunately, some widely deployed mail software
     interpreted "smtps" as "submissions" [RFC6409] and used that port for
     email submission by default when an end user requested security
     during account setup.  If a new port is assigned for the submissions
     service, either (a) email software will continue with unregistered
     use of port 465 (leaving the port registry inaccurate relative to
