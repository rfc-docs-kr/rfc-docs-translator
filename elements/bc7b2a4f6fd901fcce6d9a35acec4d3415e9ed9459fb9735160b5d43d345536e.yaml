      The quality of the security provided by the Cryptographic
      authentication option depends completely on the strength of the
      message digest algorithm (MD5 is currently the only message digest
      algorithm specified), the strength of the key being used, and the
      correct implementation of the security mechanism in all
      communicating OSPF implementations.  It also requires that all
      parties maintain the secrecy of the shared secret key.
