                    For example, consider a valid_policy_tree with a node
                    of depth i-1 where the expected_policy_set is {Gold,
                    White}.  Assume the certificate policies Gold and
                    Silver appear in the certificate policies extension of
                    certificate i.  The Gold policy is matched, but the
                    Silver policy is not.  This rule will generate a child
                    node of depth i for the Gold policy.  The result is
                    shown as Figure 4.
