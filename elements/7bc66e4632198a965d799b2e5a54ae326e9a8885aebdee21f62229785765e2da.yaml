              The Options field in the LSA header indicates which optional
              capabilities are associated with the LSA.  OSPF's optional
              capabilities are described in Section 4.5.  One optional
              capability is defined by this specification, represented by
              the E-bit found in the Options field.  The unrecognized bits
              in the Options field should be set to zero.
