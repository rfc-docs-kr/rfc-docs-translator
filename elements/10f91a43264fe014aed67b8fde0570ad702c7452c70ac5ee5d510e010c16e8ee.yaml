     The Algorithmic Drop Table identifies a dropping algorithm, drops
     packets, and counts the drops.  Classified as an action, it is in
     effect a method which applies a packet to a queue, and may modify
     either.  When the algorithm is "always drop", this is simple; when
     the algorithm calls for head-drop, tail-drop, or a variety of Active
     Queue Management, the queue is inspected, and in the case of Active
     Queue Management, additional parameters are REQUIRED.
