     Relay agents are Diameter agents that accept requests and route
     messages to other Diameter nodes based on information found in the
     messages (e.g., the value of the Destination-Realm AVP Section 6.6).
     This routing decision is performed using a list of supported realms
     and known peers.  This is known as the routing table, as is defined
     further in Section 2.7.
