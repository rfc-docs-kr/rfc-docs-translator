           Description: A BGP peer connection can be started and stopped
                        by administrative control.  This administrative
                        control can either be manual, based on operator
                        intervention, or under the control of logic that
                        is specific to a BGP implementation.  The term
                        "automatic" refers to a start being issued to the
                        BGP peer connection FSM when such logic determines
                        that the BGP peer connection should be restarted.
