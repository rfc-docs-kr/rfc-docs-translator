     With Basic NAT, a block of external addresses are set aside for
     translating addresses of hosts in a private domain as they originate
     sessions to the external domain. For packets outbound from the
     private network, the source IP address and related fields such as IP,
     TCP, UDP and ICMP header checksums are translated. For inbound
     packets, the destination IP address and the checksums as listed above
     are translated.
