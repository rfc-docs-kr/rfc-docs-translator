           o  RFC 5961 [9], Section 5 describes a potential blind data
              injection attack, and mitigation that implementations MAY
              choose to include (MAY-12).  TCP stacks that implement RFC
              5961 MUST add an input check that the ACK value is
              acceptable only if it is in the range of ((SND.UNA -
              MAX.SND.WND) =< SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT).  All incoming segments
              whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the above condition MUST be
              discarded and an ACK sent back.  The new state variable
              MAX.SND.WND is defined as the largest window that the local
              sender has ever received from its peer (subject to window
              scaling) or may be hard-coded to a maximum permissible
              window value.  When the ACK value is acceptable, the per-
              state processing below applies:
