     Implementors are encouraged to implement as many of the following
     techniques from the following list as is practical, as well as to
     explore additional NAT-traversal techniques beyond those discussed in
     this document.  However, to get a reasonable success ratio, one
     SHOULD implement at least one relayed technique (e.g., TURN) and one
     technique for discovering the address given for the host by a NAT
     (e.g., STUN).
