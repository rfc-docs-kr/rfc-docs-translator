     To improve reliability, if a peer receives a lower layer success
     indication as defined in Section 7.2, it MAY conclude that a Success
     packet has been lost, and behave as if it had actually received a
     Success packet.  This includes choosing to ignore the Success in some
     circumstances as described in Section 4.2.
