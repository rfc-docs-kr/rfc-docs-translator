                        The Weak ES Model may cause the Redirect mechanism
                        to fail.  If a datagram is sent out a physical
                        interface that does not correspond to the
                        destination address, the first-hop gateway will
                        not realize when it needs to send a Redirect.  On
                        the other hand, if the host has embedded gateway
                        functionality, then it has routing information
                        without listening to Redirects.
