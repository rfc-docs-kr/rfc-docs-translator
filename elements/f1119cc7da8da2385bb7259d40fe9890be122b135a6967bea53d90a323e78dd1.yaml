     As the bandwidth-delay product of the network increases, however,
     such increases in the advertised receive window can cause increased
     susceptibility to spoofing attacks, as the remainder of this document
     shows.  This assumes, however, that the receive window size (e.g.,
     via increased receive socket buffer configuration) is increased with
     the increased bandwidth-delay product; if not, then connection
     performance will degrade, but susceptibility to spoofing attacks will
     increase only linearly (with the rate at which the attacker can send
     spoofed packets), not as the square of the bandwidth.  Note that
     either increase depends on the receive window itself, and is
     independent of the congestion state or amount of data transmitted.

  그러나 네트워크의 대역폭-지연 곱이 증가함에 따라 광고된 수신 창의 증가로 인해 이 문서의 나머지 부분에서 볼 수 있듯이 스푸핑 공격에 대한 민감성이 높아질 수 있습니다. 그러나 이는 대역폭-지연 곱이 증가함에 따라 수신 창 크기(예: 수신 소켓 버퍼 구성 증가를 통해)가 증가한다고 가정합니다. 그렇지 않은 경우 연결 성능은 저하되지만 스푸핑 공격에 대한 취약성은 대역폭의 제곱이 아닌 선형적으로만 증가합니다(공격자가 스푸핑된 패킷을 보낼 수 있는 속도). 증가 여부는 수신 창 자체에 따라 달라지며 혼잡 상태나 전송된 데이터 양과 무관합니다.
