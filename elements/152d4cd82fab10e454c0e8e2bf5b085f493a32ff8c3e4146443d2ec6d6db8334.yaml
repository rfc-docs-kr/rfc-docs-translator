         *  Reactive (recovery) congestion management policies react to
            existing congestion problems.  All the policies described
            above for the short and medium timescales can be categorized
            as being reactive.  They are based on monitoring and
            identifying congestion problems that exist in the network and
            on the initiation of relevant actions to ease a situation.
            Reactive congestion management schemes may also be preventive.
