          AuType and Authentication
              Each OSPF packet exchange is authenticated.  Authentication
              types are assigned by the protocol and are documented in
              Appendix D.  A different authentication procedure can be
              used for each IP network/subnet.  Autype indicates the type
              of authentication procedure in use. The 64-bit
              authentication field is then for use by the chosen
              authentication procedure.  This procedure should be the last
              called when forming the packet to be sent. See Section D.4
              for details.
