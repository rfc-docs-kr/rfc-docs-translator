         The design and deployment of CIDR was intended to solve these
         problems by providing a mechanism to slow the growth of global
         routing tables and to reduce the rate of consumption of IPv4
         address space.  It did not and does not attempt to solve the
         third problem, which is of a more long-term nature; instead, it
         endeavors to ease enough of the short- to mid-term difficulties
         to allow the Internet to continue to function efficiently while
         progress is made on a longer-term solution.
