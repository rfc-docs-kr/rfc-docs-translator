     Server operators should therefore minimize the risk of using DC-
     enabled end-entity certificates where a signature forgery oracle may
     be present.  If possible, server operators may choose to use DC-
     enabled certificates only for signing credentials and not for serving
     non-DC (D)TLS traffic.  Furthermore, server operators may use
     elliptic curve certificates for DC-enabled traffic, while using RSA
     certificates without the DelegationUsage certificate extension for
     non-DC traffic; this completely prevents such attacks.
