                   Some systems extend this notion by adding a third
                   subdivision of the TCP port space: reserved ports,
                   which are generally used for operating-system-specific
                   services.  For example, reserved ports might fall
                   between 256 and some system-dependent upper limit.
                   Some systems further choose to protect well-known and
                   reserved ports by permitting only privileged users to
                   open TCP connections with those port values.  This is
                   perfectly reasonable as long as the host does not
                   assume that all hosts protect their low-numbered ports
                   in this manner.
