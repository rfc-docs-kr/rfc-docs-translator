     One purpose of TWAMP is measurement of two-way metrics.  Two-way
     measurement methods do not require packet-level data to be collected
     by the Session-Reflector (such as sequence number, timestamp, and
     Time to Live (TTL)) because this data is communicated in the
     "reflected" test packets.  As such, the protocol does not require the
     retrieval of packet-level data from the Server and the OWAMP Fetch-
     Session command is not used in TWAMP.
