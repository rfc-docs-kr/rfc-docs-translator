              When an application issues a series of SEND calls without
              setting the PUSH flag, the TCP MAY aggregate the data
              internally without sending it.  Similarly, when a series of
              segments is received without the PSH bit, a TCP MAY queue
              the data internally without passing it to the receiving
              application.
