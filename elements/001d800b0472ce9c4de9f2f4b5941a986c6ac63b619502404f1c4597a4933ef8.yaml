          At the beginning of Figure 14, Router RT1's interface to the
          network becomes operational.  It begins sending Hello Packets,
          although it doesn't know the identity of the Designated Router
          or of any other neighboring routers.  Router RT2 hears this
          hello (moving the neighbor to Init state), and in its next Hello
          Packet indicates that it is itself the Designated Router and
          that it has heard Hello Packets from RT1.  This in turn causes
          RT1 to go to state ExStart, as it starts to bring up the
          adjacency.
