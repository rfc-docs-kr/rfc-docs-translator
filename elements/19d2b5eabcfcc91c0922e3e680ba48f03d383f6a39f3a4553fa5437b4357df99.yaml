     Consider the work involved in performing a configuration update
     against a single individual device.  In making a change to the
     configuration, the application needs to build trust that its change
     has been made correctly and that it has not impacted the operation of
     the device.  The application (and the application user) should feel
     confident that their change has not damaged the network.
