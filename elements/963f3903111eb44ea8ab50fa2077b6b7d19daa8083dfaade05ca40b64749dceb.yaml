     A NAS MUST respond to a CoA-Request including a Service-Type
     Attribute with value "Authorize Only" with a CoA-NAK; a CoA-ACK MUST
     NOT be sent.  If the NAS does not support a Service-Type value of
     "Authorize Only", then it MUST respond with a CoA-NAK; an Error-Cause
     Attribute with a value of 405 (Unsupported Service) SHOULD be
     included.
