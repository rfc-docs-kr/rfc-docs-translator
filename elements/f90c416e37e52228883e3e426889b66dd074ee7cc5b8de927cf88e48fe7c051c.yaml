     UDP-tunneled NAT traversal techniques utilize the fact that UDP NAT
     traversal is simpler and more efficient than TCP NAT traversal.  With
     these techniques, the TCP packets (or possibly complete IP packets)
     are encapsulated in UDP packets.  Because of the encapsulation, these
     techniques increase the overhead for the connection and may require
     support from both of the endpoints, but on the other hand, UDP
     tunneling commonly results in reliable and fairly simple TCP NAT
     traversal.
