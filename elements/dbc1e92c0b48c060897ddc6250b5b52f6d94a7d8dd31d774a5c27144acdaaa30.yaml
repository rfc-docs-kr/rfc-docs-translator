     Fundamentally, TWAMP and OWAMP use the same protocol for
     establishment of Control and Test procedures.  The main difference
     between TWAMP and OWAMP is the Session-Reflector behavior in TWAMP
     vs. the Session-Receiver behavior in OWAMP.  This difference in
     behavior does not introduce any known security vulnerabilities that
     are not already addressed by the security features of OWAMP.  The
     entire security considerations of OWAMP [RFC4656] applies to TWAMP.
