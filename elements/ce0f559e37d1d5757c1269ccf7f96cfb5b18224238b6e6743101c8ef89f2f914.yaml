          This section describes the algorithm used for calculating a
          network's Designated Router and Backup Designated Router.  This
          algorithm is invoked by the Interface state machine.  The
          initial time a router runs the election algorithm for a network,
          the network's Designated Router and Backup Designated Router are
          initialized to 0.0.0.0.  This indicates the lack of both a
          Designated Router and a Backup Designated Router.
