     The FEAT command (introduced in [RFC-2389]) allows servers with
     additional features to advertise these to a client by responding to
     the FEAT command.  If a server supports the FEAT command, then it
     MUST advertise supported AUTH, PBSZ, and PROT commands in the reply,
     as described in section 3.2 of [RFC-2389].  Additionally, the AUTH
     command should have a reply that identifies 'TLS' as one of the
     possible parameters to AUTH.  It is not necessary to identify the
     'TLS-C' synonym separately.
