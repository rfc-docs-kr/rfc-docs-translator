     To make this example more realistic, assume that C4 and C5 are multi-
     homed through some other service provider, "PB".  Further assume the
     existence of a site, "C7", that was originally connected to "RB" but
     that has moved to "PA".  For this reason, it has a block of network
     numbers that are assigned out PB's block of (the next) 2048 x /24.
