              The router may be forced to promote the sequence number of
              one of its LSAs when a more recent instance of the LSA is
              unexpectedly received during the flooding process.  This
              should be a rare event.  This may indicate that an out-of-
              date LSA, originated by the router itself before its last
              restart/reload, still exists in the Autonomous System.  For
              more information see Section 13.4.
