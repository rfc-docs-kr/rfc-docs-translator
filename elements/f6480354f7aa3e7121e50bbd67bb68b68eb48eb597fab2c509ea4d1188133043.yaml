          In order to make the transition to a new Designated Router
          smoother, there is a Backup Designated Router for each broadcast
          and NBMA network.  The Backup Designated Router is also adjacent
          to all routers on the network, and becomes Designated Router
          when the previous Designated Router fails.  If there were no
          Backup Designated Router, when a new Designated Router became
          necessary, new adjacencies would have to be formed between the
          new Designated Router and all other routers attached to the
          network.  Part of the adjacency forming process is the
          synchronizing of link-state databases, which can potentially
          take quite a long time.  During this time, the network would not
          be available for transit data traffic.  The Backup Designated
          obviates the need to form these adjacencies, since they already
          exist.  This means the period of disruption in transit traffic
          lasts only as long as it takes to flood the new LSAs (which
          announce the new Designated Router).
