     Because the address and TCP port are encoded in ASCII, this may
     result in a change in the size of packet.  For instance,
     10,18,177,42,64,87 is 18 ASCII characters, whereas
     193,45,228,137,64,87 is 20 ASCII characters. If the new size is same
     as the previous, only the TCP checksum needs adjustment as a result
     of change of data. If the new size is less than or greater than the
     previous, TCP sequence numbers must also be changed to reflect the
     change in length of FTP control data portion.  A special table may be
     used by the ALG to correct the TCP sequence and acknowledge numbers.
     The sequence number and acknowledgement correction will need to be
     performed on all future packet of the connection.
