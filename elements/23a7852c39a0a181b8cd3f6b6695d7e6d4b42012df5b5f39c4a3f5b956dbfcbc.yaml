     A Diameter server also MUST clean up resources when the Session-
     Timeout expires, or when the Authorization-Lifetime and the Auth-
     Grace-Period AVPs expire without receipt of a re-authorization
     request, regardless of whether an STR for that session is received.
     The access device is not expected to provide service beyond the
     expiration of these timers; thus, expiration of either of these
     timers implies that the access device may have unexpectedly shut
     down.
