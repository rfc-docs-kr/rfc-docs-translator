     Similarly, an MUA MUST NOT attempt to "test" a particular Mail
     Account configuration by submitting the user's authentication
     credentials to a server, unless a TLS session meeting minimum
     confidentiality levels has been established with that server.  If
     minimum confidentiality requirements have not been satisfied, the MUA
     must explicitly warn that the user's password may be exposed to
     attackers before testing the new configuration.
