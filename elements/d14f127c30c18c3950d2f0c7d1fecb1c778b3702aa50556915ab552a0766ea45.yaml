     The Session-Server-Failover AVP (AVP Code 271) is of type Enumerated
     and MAY be present in application-specific authorization answer
     messages that either do not include the Session-Binding AVP or
     include the Session-Binding AVP with any of the bits set to a zero
     value.  If present, this AVP MAY inform the Diameter client that if a
     re-auth or STR message fails due to a delivery problem, the Diameter
     client SHOULD issue a subsequent message without the Destination-Host
     AVP.  When absent, the default value is REFUSE_SERVICE.
