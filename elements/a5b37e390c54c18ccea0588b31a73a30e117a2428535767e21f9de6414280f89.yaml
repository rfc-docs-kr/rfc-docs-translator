              In addition, the router sets bit V in its router-LSA for
              Area A if and only if the router is the endpoint of one or
              more fully adjacent virtual links having Area A as their
              Transit area. The setting of bit V enables other routers in
              Area A to discover whether the area supports transit traffic
              (see TransitCapability in Section 6).
