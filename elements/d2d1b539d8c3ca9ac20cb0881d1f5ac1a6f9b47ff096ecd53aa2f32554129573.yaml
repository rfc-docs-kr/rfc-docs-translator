     The NETCONF protocol uses a remote procedure call (RPC) paradigm.  A
     client encodes an RPC in XML [W3C.REC-xml-20001006] and sends it to a
     server using a secure, connection-oriented session.  The server
     responds with a reply encoded in XML.  The contents of both the
     request and the response are fully described in XML DTDs or XML
     schemas, or both, allowing both parties to recognize the syntax
     constraints imposed on the exchange.
