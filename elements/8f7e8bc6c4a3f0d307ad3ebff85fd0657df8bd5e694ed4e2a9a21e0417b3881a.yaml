     UID EXPUNGE is particularly useful for disconnected use clients.  By
     using UID EXPUNGE instead of EXPUNGE when resynchronizing with the
     server, the client can ensure that it does not inadvertently remove
     any messages that have been marked as \Deleted by other clients
     between the time that the client was last connected and the time the
     client resynchronizes.

  UID EXPUNGE는 연결이 끊어진 클라이언트에 특히 유용합니다.  서버와 다시 동기화할 때 EXPUNGE 대신 UID EXPUNGE를 사용하면 클라이언트가 마지막으로 연결한 시간과 클라이언트가 다시 동기화하는 시간 사이에 다른 클라이언트에 의해 \Deleted로 표시된 메시지를 실수로 제거하지 않도록 할 수 있습니다. .
