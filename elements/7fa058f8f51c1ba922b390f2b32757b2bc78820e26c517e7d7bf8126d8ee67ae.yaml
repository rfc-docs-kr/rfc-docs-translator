     This document describes a mechanism that can be used by FTP clients
     and servers to implement security and authentication using the TLS
     protocol defined by RFC 2246, "The TLS Protocol Version 1.0.", and
     the extensions to the FTP protocol defined by RFC 2228, "FTP Security
     Extensions".  It describes the subset of the extensions that are
     required and the parameters to be used, discusses some of the policy
     issues that clients and servers will need to take, considers some of
     the implications of those policies, and discusses some expected
     behaviours of implementations to allow interoperation.  This document
     is intended to provide TLS support for FTP in a similar way to that
     provided for SMTP in RFC 2487, "SMTP Service Extension for Secure
     SMTP over Transport Layer Security", and HTTP in RFC 2817, "Upgrading
     to TLS Within HTTP/1.1.".
