     *  (T1, T2, bothway) means that the Terminations matching T2 receive
        media from the Terminations matching T1, and vice versa.  In this
        case it is allowed to use wildcards such that there are
        Terminations that match both T1 and T2.  However, if there is a
        Termination that matches both, no loopback is introduced.
