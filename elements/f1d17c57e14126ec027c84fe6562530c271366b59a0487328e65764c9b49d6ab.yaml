      All OSPF packet types (other than the OSPF Hello packets) deal with
      lists of LSAs.  For example, Link State Update packets implement the
      flooding of LSAs throughout the OSPF routing domain.  Because of
      this, OSPF protocol packets cannot be parsed unless the format of
      LSAs is also understood.  The format of LSAs is described in Section
      A.4.
