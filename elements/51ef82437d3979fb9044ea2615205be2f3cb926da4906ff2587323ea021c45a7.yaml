        The peer SHOULD display this message to the user or log it if it
        cannot be displayed.  The Notification Type is intended to provide
        an acknowledged notification of some imperative nature, but it is
        not an error indication, and therefore does not change the state
        of the peer.  Examples include a password with an expiration time
        that is about to expire, an OTP sequence integer which is nearing
        0, an authentication failure warning, etc.  In most circumstances,
        Notification should not be required.
