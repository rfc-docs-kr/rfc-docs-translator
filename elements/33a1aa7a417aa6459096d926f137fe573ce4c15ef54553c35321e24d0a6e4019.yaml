          (1) Calculate the distance D of stub network from the root.  D
              is equal to the distance from the root to the router vertex
              (calculated in stage 1), plus the stub network link's
              advertised cost.  Compare this distance to the current best
              cost to the stub network.  This is done by looking up the
              stub network's current routing table entry.  If the
              calculated distance D is larger, go on to examine the next
              stub network link in the LSA.
