     Messages, being carried over UDP, may be subject to losses. In the
     absence of a timely response, commands are repeated. Most commands
     are not idempotent.  The state of the MG would become unpredictable
     if, for example, Add commands were executed several times.  The
     transmission procedures shall thus provide an "At- Most-Once"
     functionality.
