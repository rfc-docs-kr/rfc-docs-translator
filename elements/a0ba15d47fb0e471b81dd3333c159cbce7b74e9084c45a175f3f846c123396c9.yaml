          Before the lookup begins, "discard" routing table entries should
          be inserted into the routing table for each of the router's
          active area address ranges (see Section 3.5).  (An area range is
          considered "active" if the range contains one or more networks
          reachable by intra-area paths.) The destination of a "discard"
          entry is the set of addresses described by its associated active
          area address range, and the path type of each "discard" entry is
          set to "inter-area".[10]
