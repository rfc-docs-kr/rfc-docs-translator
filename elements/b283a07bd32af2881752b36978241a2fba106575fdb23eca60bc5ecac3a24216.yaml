     TCP-based candidates are encoded into a=candidate lines like the UDP
     candidates described in [RFC5245].  However, the transport protocol
     (i.e., value of the transport-extension token defined in [RFC5245],
     Section 15.1) is set to "TCP" and the connection type (active,
     passive, or S-O) is encoded using a new extension attribute.  With
     TCP candidates, the candidate-attribute syntax with Augmented BNF
     [RFC5234] is then:
