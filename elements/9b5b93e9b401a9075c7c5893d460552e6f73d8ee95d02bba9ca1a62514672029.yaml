     The server SHOULD only check the status of the data protection level
     (for options 3 and 4 above) on the actual command that will initiate
     the data transfer (and not on the PORT or PASV).  The following
     commands, defined in [RFC-959], cause data connections to be opened
     and thus may be rejected before any 1xx message due to an incorrect
     PROT setting.
