     The parameters to a command are termed Descriptors. A Descriptor
     consists of a name and a list of items. Some items may have values.
     Many Commands share common Descriptors.  This subsection enumerates
     these Descriptors.  Descriptors may be returned as output from a
     command.  In any such return of descriptor contents, an empty
     descriptor is represented by its name unaccompanied by any list.
     Parameters and parameter usage specific to a given Command type are
     described in the subsection that describes the Command.
