     The introduction of an information-centric networking architecture
     and the corresponding communication paradigm results in changes to
     many aspects of network security.  These will affect all scenarios
     described in [RFC7476].  Additional evaluation will be required to
     ensure relevant security requirements are appropriately met by the
     implementation of the chosen architecture in the various scenarios.
