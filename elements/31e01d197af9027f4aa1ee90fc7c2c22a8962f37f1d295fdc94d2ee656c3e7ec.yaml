     A classifier element is a structural element, indexed by classifier
     ID and element ID.  It has a precedence value, allowing for
     structured ambiguity as described above, a "specific" pointer that
     identifies what rule is to be applied, and a "next" pointer directing
     traffic matching the classifier to the next functional data path
     element.  If the "next" pointer is zeroDotZero, the indication is
     that there is no further differentiated services processing for this
     behavior aggregate.  However, if the "specific" pointer is
     zeroDotZero, the device is misconfigured.  In such a case, the
     classifier element should be operationally treated as if it were not
     present.
