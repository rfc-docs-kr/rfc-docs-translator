           Finally, some configuration options are required to communicate
           with obsolete or incorrect implementations of the protocols,
           distributed without sources, that unfortunately persist in many
           parts of the Internet.  To make correct systems coexist with
           these faulty systems, administrators often have to "mis-
           configure" the correct systems.  This problem will correct
           itself gradually as the faulty systems are retired, but it
           cannot be ignored by vendors.
