        Method: This specification defines six methods: REGISTER for
             registering contact information, INVITE, ACK, and CANCEL for
             setting up sessions, BYE for terminating sessions, and
             OPTIONS for querying servers about their capabilities.  SIP
             extensions, documented in standards track RFCs, may define
             additional methods.
