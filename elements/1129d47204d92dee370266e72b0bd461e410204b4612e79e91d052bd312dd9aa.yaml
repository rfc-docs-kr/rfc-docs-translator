     In OWAMP, the Conf-Sender field is set to 1 when the Request-Session
     message describes a task where the Server will configure a one-way
     test packet sender.  Likewise, the Conf-Receiver field is set to 1
     when the message describes the configuration for a Session-Receiver.
     In TWAMP, both endpoints send and receive test packets, with the
     Session-Sender first sending and then receiving test packets,
     complimented by the Session-Reflector first receiving and then
     sending.
