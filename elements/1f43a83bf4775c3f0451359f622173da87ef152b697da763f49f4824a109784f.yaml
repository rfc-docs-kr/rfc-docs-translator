     2.  Denial-of-service attacks can be launched against many parts of
         the Internet infrastructure by advertising a large number of
         routes into the system.  Such an attack is intended to cause
         router failures by overflowing routing and forwarding tables.  A
         good example of a non-malicious incident that caused this sort of
         failure was the infamous "AS 7007" event [7007], where a router
         mis-configuration by an operator caused a huge number of invalid
         routes to be propagated through the global routing system.
         Again, this sort of attack is not really new with CIDR; using
         legacy Class A/B/C routes, it was possible to advertise a maximum
         of 16843008 unique network numbers into the global routing
         system, a number that is sufficient to cause problems for even
