     o  Certification path validation: The TLS peer is configured with one
        or more trust anchors (typically root CA (certification authority)
        certificates), which allow it to verify a binding between the
        subject name and the public key.  Additional policy controls
        needed for authorizing the syslog transport sender and receiver
        (i.e., verifying that the subject name represents an authorized
        party) are described in Section 5.  Certification path validation
        is performed as defined in [RFC5280].  This method is useful where
        there is a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployment.
