     The M3UA layer does not impose a 272-octet signalling information
     field (SIF) length limit as specified by the SS7 MTP Level 2 protocol
     [7,8,9].  Larger information blocks can be accommodated directly by
     M3UA/SCTP, without the need for an upper layer segmentation/
     re-assembly procedure as specified in recent SCCP or ISUP versions.
     However, in the context of an SG, the maximum 272-octet block size
     must be followed when interworking to a SS7 network that does not
     support the transfer of larger information blocks to the final
     destination.  This avoids potential ISUP or SCCP fragmentation
     requirements at the SGPs.  The provisioning and configuration of the
     SS7 network determines the restriction placed on the maximum block
