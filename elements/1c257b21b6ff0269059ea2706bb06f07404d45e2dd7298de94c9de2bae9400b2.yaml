     Diameter may also be used for services that cannot be easily
     categorized as authentication, authorization, or accounting (e.g.,
     certain Third Generation Partnership Project Internet Multimedia
     System (3GPP IMS) interfaces).  In such cases, the finite state
     machine defined in subsequent sections may not be applicable.
     Therefore, the application itself MAY need to define its own finite
     state machine.  However, such application-specific state machines
     SHOULD follow the general state machine framework outlined in this
     document such as the use of Session-Id AVPs and the use of STR/STA,
     ASR/ASA messages for stateful sessions.
