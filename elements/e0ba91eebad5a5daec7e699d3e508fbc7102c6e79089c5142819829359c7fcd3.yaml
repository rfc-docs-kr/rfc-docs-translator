              IMPLEMENTATION:
                   There is a common implementation error in UDP
                   checksums.  Unlike the TCP checksum, the UDP checksum
                   is optional; the value zero is transmitted in the
                   checksum field of a UDP header to indicate the absence
                   of a checksum.  If the transmitter really calculates a
                   UDP checksum of zero, it must transmit the checksum as
                   all 1's (65535).  No special action is required at the
                   receiver, since zero and 65535 are equivalent in 1's
                   complement arithmetic.
