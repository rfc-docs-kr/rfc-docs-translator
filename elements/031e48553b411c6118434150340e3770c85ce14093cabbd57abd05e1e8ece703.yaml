        (b)  initialization:  Before a client system can operate securely,
             it is necessary to install key materials that have the
             appropriate relationship with keys stored elsewhere in the
             infrastructure.  For example, the client needs to be securely
             initialized with the public key and other assured information
             of the trusted CA(s), to be used in validating certificate
             paths.
