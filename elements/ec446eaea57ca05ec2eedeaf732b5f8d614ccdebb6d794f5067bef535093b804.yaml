           This document requires a particular value for such defaults in
           some cases.  The choice of default is a sensitive issue when
           the configuration item controls the accommodation to existing
           faulty systems.  If the Internet is to converge successfully to
           complete interoperability, the default values built into
           implementations must implement the official protocol, not
           "mis-configurations" to accommodate faulty implementations.
           Although marketing considerations have led some vendors to
           choose mis-configuration defaults, we urge vendors to choose
           defaults that will conform to the standard.
