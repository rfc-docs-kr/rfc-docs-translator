     The discussion of the RTO from RFC 793 was updated to refer to RFC
     6298.  The text on the RTO in RFC 1122 originally replaced the text
     in RFC 793; however, RFC 2988 should have updated RFC 1122 and has
     subsequently been obsoleted by RFC 6298.

  RFC 793의 RTO에 대한 논의는 RFC 6298을 참조하도록 업데이트되었습니다. RFC 1122의 RTO 텍스트는 원래 RFC 793의 텍스트를 대체했습니다. 그러나 RFC 2988은 RFC 1122를 업데이트해야 했으며 이후 RFC 6298에 의해 폐기되었습니다.
