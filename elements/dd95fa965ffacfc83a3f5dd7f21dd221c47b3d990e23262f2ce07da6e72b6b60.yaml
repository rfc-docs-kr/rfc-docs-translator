     Import Policy: a local policy to be applied to the information
     contained in the Adj-RIBs-In.  As described in Section 3.2 [RFC4271],
     the Adj-RIBs-In contain information learned from other BGP speakers,
     and the application of the Import Policy results in the routes that
     will be considered in the Decision Process by the local BGP speaker.
