        Traditional NAT implementations that do not track datagrams on
        a per-session basis but lump states of multiple UDP sessions
        using the same address binding into a single unified session
        could compromise the security even further. This is because,
        the granularity of packet matching would be further limited to
        just the destination address of the inbound UDP packets.
