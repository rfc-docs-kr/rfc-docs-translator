     As with any peer-to-peer protocol, proper configuration of the trust
     model within a Diameter peer is essential to security.  When
     certificates are used, it is necessary to configure the root
     certificate authorities trusted by the Diameter peer.  These root CAs
     are likely to be unique to Diameter usage and distinct from the root
     CAs that might be trusted for other purposes such as Web browsing.
     In general, it is expected that those root CAs will be configured so
     as to reflect the business relationships between the organization
     hosting the Diameter peer and other organizations.  As a result, a
     Diameter peer will typically not be configured to allow connectivity
     with any arbitrary peer.  With certificate authentication, Diameter
     peers may not be known beforehand and therefore peer discovery may be
     required.
