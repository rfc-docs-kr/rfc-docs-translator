     For a particular network, the host SHOULD use the addresses of local
     routers (preferably default gateways) as its test nodes.  If more
     than one address is known, those addresses may be tested in parallel.
     In order to ensure configuration validity, the host SHOULD only
     configure routes for which the next hop address passes the
     reachability test.  Other routes SHOULD be re-learned.
