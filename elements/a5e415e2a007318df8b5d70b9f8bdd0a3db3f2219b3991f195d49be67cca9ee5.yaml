          This section has assumed that packets destined for external
          destinations are always routed through the advertising AS
          boundary router.  This is not always desirable.  For example,
          suppose in Figure 2 there is an additional router attached to
          Network N6, called Router RTX.  Suppose further that RTX does
          not participate in OSPF routing, but does exchange BGP
          information with the AS boundary router RT7.  Then, Router RT7
          would end up advertising OSPF external routes for all
          destinations that should be routed to RTX.  An extra hop will
          sometimes be introduced if packets for these destinations need
          always be routed first to Router RT7 (the advertising router).
