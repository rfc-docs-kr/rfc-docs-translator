     While parameters like Huffman tables and color space are likely to
     remain fixed for the lifetime of the video stream, other parameters
     should be allowed to vary, notably the quantization tables and image
     size (e.g., to implement rate-adaptive transmission or allow a user
     to adjust the "quality level" or resolution manually).  Thus explicit
     fields in the RTP/JPEG header are allocated to represent this
     information.  Since only a small set of quantization tables are
     typically used, we encode the entire set of quantization tables in a
     small integer field.  Customized quantization tables are accommodated
     by using a special range of values in this field, and then placing
     the table before the beginning of the JPEG payload.  The image width
     and height are encoded explicitly.
