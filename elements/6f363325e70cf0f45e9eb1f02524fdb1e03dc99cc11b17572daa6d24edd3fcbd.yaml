     5. If exactly one candidate remains and it has been fully matched, a
        completion event is generated indicating an unambiguous match. If
        no candidates remain, the latest event is removed from the current
        dial string and a completion event is generated indicating full
        match if one of the candidates from the previous step was fully
        satisfied before the latest event was detected, or partial match
        otherwise.  The event removed from the current dial string will
        then be reported as per the currently active event processing
        mechanisms.
