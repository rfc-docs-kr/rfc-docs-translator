        Reserved:  Not assigned and not available for assignment.
              Reserved values are held for special uses, such as to extend
              the namespace when it becomes exhausted.  "Reserved" is also
              sometimes used to designate values that had been assigned
              but are no longer in use, keeping them set aside as long as
              other unassigned values are available.  Note that this is
              distinctly different from "Unassigned".
