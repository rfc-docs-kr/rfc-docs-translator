     An obvious question to ask is whether CIDR can continue to be a
     viable approach to keeping global routing state growth and address
     space depletion at sustainable rates.  Recent measurements indicate
     that exponential growth has resumed, but further analysis suggests
     that this trend can be mitigated by a more active effort to educate
     service providers as to efficient aggregation strategies and proper
     equipment configuration.  Looking farther forward, there is a clear
     need for better multi-homing technology that does not require global
     routing state for each site and for methods of performing traffic
     load balancing that do not require adding even more state.  Without
     such developments and in the absence of major architectural change,
     aggregation is the only tool available for making routing scale in
     the global Internet.
