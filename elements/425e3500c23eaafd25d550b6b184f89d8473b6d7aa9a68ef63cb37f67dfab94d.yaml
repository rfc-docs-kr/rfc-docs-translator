      [18]This clause is only invoked when a non-backbone Area A supports
      transit data traffic (i.e., has TransitCapability set to TRUE).  For
      example, in the area configuration of Figure 6, Area 2 can support
      transit traffic due to the configured virtual link between Routers
      RT10 and RT11. As a result, Router RT11 need only originate a single
      summary-LSA into Area 2 (having the collapsed destination N9-
      N11,H1), since all of Router RT11's other eligible routes have next
      hops belonging to Area 2 itself (and as such only need be advertised
      by other area border routers; in this case, Routers RT10 and RT7).
