          This section explains the detailed processing of a received
          Hello Packet.  (See Section A.3.2 for the format of Hello
          packets.)  The generic input processing of OSPF packets will
          have checked the validity of the IP header and the OSPF packet
          header.  Next, the values of the Network Mask, HelloInterval,
          and RouterDeadInterval fields in the received Hello packet must
          be checked against the values configured for the receiving
          interface.  Any mismatch causes processing to stop and the
          packet to be dropped.  In other words, the above fields are
          really describing the attached network's configuration. However,
          there is one exception to the above rule: on point-to-point
          networks and on virtual links, the Network Mask in the received
          Hello Packet should be ignored.
