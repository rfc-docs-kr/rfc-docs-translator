           b) The aggregated AS_PATH attribute consists of ASes identified
              in (a), in exactly the same order as they appear in the
              AS_PATH attributes to be aggregated.  If two consecutive
              ASes identified in (a) do not immediately follow each other
              in both of the AS_PATH attributes to be aggregated, then the
              intervening ASes (ASes that are between the two consecutive
              ASes that are the same) in both attributes are combined into
              an AS_SET path segment that consists of the intervening ASes
              from both AS_PATH attributes.  This segment is then placed
              between the two consecutive ASes identified in (a) of the
              aggregated attribute.  If two consecutive ASes identified in
              (a) immediately follow each other in one attribute, but do
              not follow in another, then the intervening ASes of the
              latter are combined into an AS_SET path segment.  This
              segment is then placed between the two consecutive ASes
              identified in (a) of the aggregated attribute.
