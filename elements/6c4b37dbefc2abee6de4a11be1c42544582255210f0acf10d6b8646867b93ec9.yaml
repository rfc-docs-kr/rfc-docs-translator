                  o   Less than the value that appears for vertex W on the
                      candidate list, or if W does not yet appear on the
                      candidate list, then set the entry for W on the
                      candidate list to indicate a distance of D from the
                      root.  Also calculate the list of next hops that
                      result from using the advertised link, setting the
                      next hop values for W accordingly.  The next hop
                      calculation is described in Section 16.1.1; it takes
                      as input the destination (W) and its parent (V).
