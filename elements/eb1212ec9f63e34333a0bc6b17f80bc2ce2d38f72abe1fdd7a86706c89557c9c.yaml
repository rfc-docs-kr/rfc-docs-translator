     Note that the general effect of this algorithm is to advance RCV.WND
     in increments of Eff.snd.MSS (for realistic receive buffers:
     Eff.snd.MSS < RCV.BUFF/2).  Note also that the receiver must use its
     own Eff.snd.MSS, making the assumption that it is the same as the
     sender's.

  이 알고리즘의 일반적인 효과는 Eff.snd.MSS의 증분으로 RCV.WND를 향상시키는 것입니다(현실적인 수신 버퍼의 경우: Eff.snd.MSS < RCV.BUFF/2). 또한 수신자는 자신의 Eff.snd.MSS를 사용해야 하며 송신자의 것과 동일하다고 가정해야 합니다.
