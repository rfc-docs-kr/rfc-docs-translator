        The legacy Nak Type is valid only in Response messages.  It is
        sent in reply to a Request where the desired authentication Type
        is unacceptable.  Authentication Types are numbered 4 and above.
        The Response contains one or more authentication Types desired by
        the Peer.  Type zero (0) is used to indicate that the sender has
        no viable alternatives, and therefore the authenticator SHOULD NOT
        send another Request after receiving a Nak Response containing a
        zero value.
