     In this case, external addresses are assigned to private network
     hosts or vice versa, dynamically based on usage requirements and
     session flow determined heuristically by NAT. When the last session
     using an address binding is terminated, NAT would free the binding so
     that the global address could be recycled for later use. The exact
     nature of address assignment is specific to individual NAT
     implementations.
