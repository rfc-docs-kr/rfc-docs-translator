     The approach taken with CoA commands in existing implementations
     results in a semantic ambiguity.  Existing implementations of the
     CoA-Request identify the affected session, as well as supply the
     authorization changes.  Since RADIUS Attributes included within
     existing implementations of the CoA-Request can be used for session
     identification or authorization change, it may not be clear which
     function a given attribute is serving.
