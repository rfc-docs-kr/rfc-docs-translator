            If a site is not in a transit VPN, note that it need not have
            a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN).  Every CE whose site
            which is not in a transit VPN can use the same ASN.  This can
            be chosen from the private ASN space, and it will be stripped
            out by the PE.  Routing loops are prevented by use of the Site
            of Origin Attribute (see below).
