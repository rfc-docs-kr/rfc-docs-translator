     Within EAP, Success and Failure packets are neither acknowledged nor
     integrity protected.  Result indications improve resilience to loss
     of Success and Failure packets when EAP is run over lower layers
     which do not support retransmission or synchronization of the
     authentication state.  In media such as IEEE 802.11, which provides
     for retransmission, as well as synchronization of authentication
     state via the 4-way handshake defined in [IEEE-802.11i], additional
     resilience is typically of marginal benefit.
