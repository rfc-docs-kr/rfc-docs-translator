        SIP-Version: Both request and response messages include the
             version of SIP in use, and follow [H3.1] (with HTTP replaced
             by SIP, and HTTP/1.1 replaced by SIP/2.0) regarding version
             ordering, compliance requirements, and upgrading of version
             numbers.  To be compliant with this specification,
             applications sending SIP messages MUST include a SIP-Version
             of "SIP/2.0".  The SIP-Version string is case-insensitive,
             but implementations MUST send upper-case.
