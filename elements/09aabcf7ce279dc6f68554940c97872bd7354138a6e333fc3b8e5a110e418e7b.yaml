                All Internet transport protocols use the Internet Protocol
                (IP) to carry data from source host to destination host.
                IP is a connectionless or datagram internetwork service,
                providing no end-to-end delivery guarantees. Thus, IP
                datagrams may arrive at the destination host damaged,
                duplicated, out of order, or not at all.  The layers above
                IP are responsible for reliable delivery service when it
                is required.  The IP protocol includes provision for
                addressing, type-of-service specification, fragmentation
                and reassembly, and security information.
