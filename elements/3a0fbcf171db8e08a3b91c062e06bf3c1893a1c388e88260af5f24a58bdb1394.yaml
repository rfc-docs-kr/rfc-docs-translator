     The Supported-Vendor-Id AVP (AVP Code 265) is of type Unsigned32 and
     contains the IANA "SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Codes"
     [ENTERPRISE] value assigned to a vendor other than the device vendor
     but including the application vendor.  This is used in the CER and
     CEA messages in order to inform the peer that the sender supports (a
     subset of) the Vendor-Specific AVPs defined by the vendor identified
     in this AVP.  The value of this AVP MUST NOT be set to zero.
     Multiple instances of this AVP containing the same value SHOULD NOT
     be sent.
