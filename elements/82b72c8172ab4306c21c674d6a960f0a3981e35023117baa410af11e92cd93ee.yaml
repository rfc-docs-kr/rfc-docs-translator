     The <rpc> element has a mandatory attribute "message-id", which is a
     string chosen by the sender of the RPC that will commonly encode a
     monotonically increasing integer.  The receiver of the RPC does not
     decode or interpret this string but simply saves it to be used as a
     "message-id" attribute in any resulting <rpc-reply> message.  The
     sender MUST ensure that the "message-id" value is normalized
     according to the XML attribute value normalization rules defined in
     [W3C.REC-xml-20001006] if the sender wants the string to be returned
     unmodified.  For example:
"fixed": !!null |-
  null
"ko": !!null |-
  null
