                        ipno/bits  An IP number as above with a mask
                                   width of the form 192.0.2.10/24.  In
                                   this case, all IP numbers from
                                   192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 will match.
                                   The bit width MUST be valid for the
                                   IP version, and the IP number MUST
                                   NOT have bits set beyond the mask.
                                   For a match to occur, the same IP
                                   version must be present in the
                                   packet that was used in describing
                                   the IP address.  To test for a
                                   particular IP version, the bits part
                                   can be set to zero.  The keyword
                                   "any" is 0.0.0.0/0 or the IPv6
                                   equivalent.  The keyword "assigned"
                                   is the address or set of addresses
                                   assigned to the terminal.  For IPv4,
                                   a typical first rule is often "deny
                                   in ip! assigned".
