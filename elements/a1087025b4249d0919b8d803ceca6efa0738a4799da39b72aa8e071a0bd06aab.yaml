          RouterDeadInterval
              After ceasing to hear a router's Hello Packets, the number
              of seconds before its neighbors declare the router down.
              This is also advertised in the router's Hello Packets in
              their RouterDeadInterval field.  This should be some
              multiple of the HelloInterval (say 4).  This value again
              must be the same for all routers attached to a common
              network.
