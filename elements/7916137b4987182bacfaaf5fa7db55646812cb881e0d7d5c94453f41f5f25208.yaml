     The algorithms presented here were designed to be easy to implement
     in constant time to avoid side-channel vulnerabilities.  The
     operations used in ChaCha20 are all additions, XORs, and fixed
     rotations.  All of these can and should be implemented in constant
     time.  Access to offsets into the ChaCha state and the number of
     operations do not depend on any property of the key, eliminating the
     chance of information about the key leaking through the timing of
     cache misses.
