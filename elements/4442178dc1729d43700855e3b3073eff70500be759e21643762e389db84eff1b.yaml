                   Keeping the right window edge fixed as data arrives and
                   is acknowledged requires that the receiver offer less
                   than its full buffer space, i.e., the receiver must
                   specify a RCV.WND that keeps RCV.NXT+RCV.WND constant
                   as RCV.NXT increases.  Thus, the total buffer space
                   RCV.BUFF is generally divided into three parts:
