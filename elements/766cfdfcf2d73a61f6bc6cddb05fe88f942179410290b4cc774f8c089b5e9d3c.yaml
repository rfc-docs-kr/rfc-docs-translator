     The type field specifies the information that would otherwise be
     present in a JPEG abbreviated table-specification as well as the
     additional JFIF-style parameters not defined by JPEG.  Types 0-63 are
     reserved as fixed, well-known mappings to be defined by this document
     and future revisions of this document.  Types 64-127 are the same as
     types 0-63, except that restart markers are present in the JPEG data
     and a Restart Marker header appears immediately following the main
     JPEG header.  Types 128-255 are free to be dynamically defined by a
     session setup protocol (which is beyond the scope of this document).
