     Note that during failures, partial routing of traffic to a site that
     takes its address space from one service provider but that is
     actually reachable only through another (i.e., the case of a site
     that has changed service providers) may occur because such traffic
     will be forwarded along the path advertised by the aggregated route.
     Rule #2 will prevent packet misdelivery by causing such traffic to be
     discarded by the advertiser of the aggregated route, but the output
     of "traceroute" and other similar tools will suggest that a problem
     exists within that network rather than in the network that is no
     longer advertising the more-specific prefix.  This may be confusing
     to those trying to diagnose connectivity problems; see the example in
     Section 6.2 for details.  A solution to this perceived "problem" is
     beyond the scope of this document; it lies with better education of
     the user/operator community, not in routing technology.
