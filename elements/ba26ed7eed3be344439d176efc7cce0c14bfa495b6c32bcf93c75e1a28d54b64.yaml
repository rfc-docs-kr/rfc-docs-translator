     Typically, such a table has an associated NextFree variable e.g.
     diffServClfrNextFree which provides a suitable value for the index of
     the next row to be created e.g. diffServClfrId.  The value zero is
     used to indicate that the agent can configure no more entries.  The
     table also has a columnar Status attribute with RowStatus syntax [RFC
     2579].
