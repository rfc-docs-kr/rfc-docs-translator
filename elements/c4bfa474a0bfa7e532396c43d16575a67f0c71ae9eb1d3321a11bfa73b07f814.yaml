               Note that here, and in all other places where UTF-8
               encoding is used in the CoAP protocol, the intention is
               that the encoded strings can be directly used and compared
               as opaque byte strings by CoAP protocol implementations.
               There is no expectation and no need to perform
               normalization within a CoAP implementation (except where
               Unicode strings that are not known to be normalized are
               imported from sources outside the CoAP protocol).  Note
               also that ASCII strings (that do not make use of special
               control characters) are always valid UTF-8 Net-Unicode
               strings.
