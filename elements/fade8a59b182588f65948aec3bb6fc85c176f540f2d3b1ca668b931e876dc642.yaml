     An organization that decides to use IP addresses in the address space
     defined above can do so without coordination with IANA or any other
     Internet registry such as APNIC, RIPE and ARIN.  The address space
     can thus be used privately by many independent organizations at the
     same time. However, if those independent organizations later decide
     they wish to communicate with each other or the public Internet, they
     will either have to renumber their networks or enable NAT on their
     border routers.
