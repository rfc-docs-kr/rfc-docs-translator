     When the client moves between networks, the address re-validation
     attempt may be unsuccessful; a DHCPNAK may be received in response to
     a DHCPREQUEST, causing the client to restart the configuration
     process by moving to the INIT state.  If an address previously
     obtained on the new network is still operable, DNAv4 enables the host
     to confirm the new configuration quickly, bypassing restart of the
     configuration process and conflict detection.
