     The REG REQ message is sent by an ASP to indicate to a remote M3UA
     peer that it wishes to register one or more given Routing Keys with
     the remote peer.  Typically, an ASP would send this message to an SGP
     and expect to receive a REG RSP message in return with an associated
     Routing Context value.
