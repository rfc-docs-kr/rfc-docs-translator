     When a user session that required Diameter authorization terminates,
     the access device that provided the service MUST issue a Session-
     Termination-Request (STR) message to the Diameter server that
     authorized the service, to notify it that the session is no longer
     active.  An STR MUST be issued when a user session terminates for any
     reason, including user logoff, expiration of Session-Timeout,
     administrative action, termination upon receipt of an Abort-Session-
     Request (see below), orderly shutdown of the access device, etc.
