        The values 8,388,608 - 16,777,213 (0x800000 - 0xfffffd) are
        reserved for vendor-specific Command Codes, to be allocated on a
        First Come, First Served basis by IANA [RFC5226].  The request to
        IANA for a Vendor-Specific Command Code SHOULD include a reference
        to a publicly available specification that documents the command
        in sufficient detail to aid in interoperability between
        independent implementations.  If the specification cannot be made
        publicly available, the request for a vendor-specific Command Code
        MUST include the contact information of persons and/or entities
        responsible for authoring and maintaining the command.
