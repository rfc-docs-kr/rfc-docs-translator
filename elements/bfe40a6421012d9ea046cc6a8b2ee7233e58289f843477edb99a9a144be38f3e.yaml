        - Exhaustion of the class-B network address space. One
          fundamental cause of this problem is the lack of a network
          class of a size that is appropriate for a mid-sized
          organization. Class-C, with a maximum of 254 host addresses, is
          too small, while class-B, which allows up to 65534 addresses,
          is too large to be densely populated.  The result is inefficient
          utilization of class-B network numbers.
