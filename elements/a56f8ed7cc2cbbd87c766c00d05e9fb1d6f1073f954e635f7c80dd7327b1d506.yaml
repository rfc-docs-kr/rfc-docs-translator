     In the example provided in Figure 1, peer connection A is established
     between the client and the relay.  Peer connection B is established
     between the relay and the server.  User session X spans from the
     client via the relay to the server.  Each "user" of a service causes
     an auth request to be sent, with a unique session identifier.  Once
     accepted by the server, both the client and the server are aware of
     the session.
