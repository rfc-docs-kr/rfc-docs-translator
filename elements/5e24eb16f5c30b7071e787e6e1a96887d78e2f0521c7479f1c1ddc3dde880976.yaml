     When a peer is deemed suspect, which could occur for various reasons,
     including not receiving a DWA within an allotted time frame, no new
     requests should be forwarded to the peer, but failover procedures are
     invoked.  When an active peer is moved to this mode, additional
     connections SHOULD be established to ensure that the necessary number
     of active connections exists.
