     In a text encoding of the protocol, while TerminationIDs are
     arbitrary, by judicious choice of names, the wildcard character, "*"
     may be made more useful.  When the wildcard character is encountered,
     it will "match" all TerminationIDs having the same previous and
     following characters (if appropriate).  For example, if there were
     TerminationIDs of R13/3/1, R13/3/2 and R13/3/3, the TerminationID
     R13/3/* would match all of them.  There are some circumstances where
     ALL Terminations must be referred to.  The TerminationID "*"
     suffices, and is referred to as ALL. The CHOOSE TerminationID "$" may
     be used to signal to the MG that it has to create an ephemeral
     Termination or select an idle physical Termination.
