              (2) The checksum field in the standard OSPF header is set to
                  the standard IP checksum of the entire contents of the
                  packet, starting with the OSPF packet header but
                  excluding the 64-bit authentication field.  This
                  checksum is calculated as the 16-bit one's complement of
                  the one's complement sum of all the 16-bit words in the
                  packet, excepting the authentication field.  If the
                  packet's length is not an integral number of 16-bit
                  words, the packet is padded with a byte of zero before
                  checksumming.
