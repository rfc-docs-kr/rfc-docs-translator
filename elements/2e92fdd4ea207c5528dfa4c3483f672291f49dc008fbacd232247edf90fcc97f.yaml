        This Informational RFC described several operational issues
        associated with the allocation of classless prefixes from
        previously-classful address space.  With the full deployment of
        CIDR on the Internet and more than half a dozen years of
        experience making classless prefix allocations out of historical
        "Class A" address space, this RFC now has only historical value.
