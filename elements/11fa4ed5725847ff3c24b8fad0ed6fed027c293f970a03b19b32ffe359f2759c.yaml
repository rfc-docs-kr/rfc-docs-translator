          Checksum
              The standard IP 16-bit one's complement checksum of the
              entire OSPF packet, excluding the 64-bit authentication
              field.  This checksum is calculated as part of the
              appropriate authentication procedure; for some OSPF
              authentication types, the checksum calculation is omitted.
              See Section D.4 for details.
