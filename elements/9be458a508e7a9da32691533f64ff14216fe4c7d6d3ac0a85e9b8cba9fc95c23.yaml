                        An example of DampPeerOscillations logic is an
                        increase of the IdleHoldTime value if a BGP peer
                        oscillates connectivity (connected/disconnected)
                        repeatedly within a time period.  To engage this
                        logic, a peer could connect and disconnect 10
                        times within 5 minutes.  The IdleHoldTime value
                        would be reset from 0 to 120 seconds.
