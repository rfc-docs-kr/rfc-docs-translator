          o SPI -- modified to specify a uniform algorithm for SAD lookup
            for unicast and multicast SAs, covering a wider range of
            multicast technologies.  For unicast, the SPI may be used
            alone to select an SA, or may be combined with the protocol,
            at the option of the receiver.  For multicast SAs, the SPI is
            combined with the destination address, and optionally the
            source address, to select an SA.
          o Extended Sequence Number -- added a new option for a 64-bit
            sequence number for very high-speed communications.  Clarified
            sender and receiver processing requirements for multicast SAs
            and multi-sender SAs.
          o Payload data -- broadened model to accommodate combined mode
            algorithms.
          o Padding for improved traffic flow confidentiality -- added
            requirement to be able to add bytes after the end of the IP
            Payload, prior to the beginning of the Padding field.
          o Next Header -- added requirement to be able to generate and
            discard dummy padding packets (Next Header = 59)
          o ICV -- broadened model to accommodate combined mode
            algorithms.
          o Algorithms -- Added combined confidentiality mode algorithms.
          o Moved references to mandatory algorithms to a separate
            document.
          o Inbound and Outbound packet processing -- there are now two
            paths: (1) separate confidentiality and integrity
            algorithms and (2) combined confidentiality mode
            algorithms.  Because of the addition of combined mode
            algorithms, the encryption/decryption and integrity sections
            have been combined for both inbound and outbound packet
            processing.
