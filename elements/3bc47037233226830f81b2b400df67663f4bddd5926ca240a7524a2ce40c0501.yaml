         enough for traffic protocols such as IPsec and TLS, but may be
         too small for file and/or disk encryption.  For such uses, we can
         return to the original design, reduce the nonce to 64 bits, and
         use the integer at position 13 as the top 32 bits of a 64-bit
         block counter, increasing the total message size to over a
         million petabytes (1,180,591,620,717,411,303,360 bytes to be
         exact).
