          The router's optional OSPF capabilities (see Section 4.5) are
          transmitted to the neighbor in the Options field of the Database
          Description packet.  The router should maintain the same set of
          optional capabilities throughout the Database Exchange and
          flooding procedures.  If for some reason the router's optional
          capabilities change, the Database Exchange procedure should be
          restarted by reverting to neighbor state ExStart.  One optional
          capability is defined in this specification (see Sections 4.5
          and A.2). The E-bit should be set if and only if the attached
          network belongs to a non-stub area. Unrecognized bits in the
          Options field should be set to zero.
