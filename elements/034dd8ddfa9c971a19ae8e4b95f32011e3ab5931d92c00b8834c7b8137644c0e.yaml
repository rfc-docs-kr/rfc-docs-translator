     The server MUST include the value from the Source Connection ID field
     of the packet it receives in the Destination Connection ID field.
     The value for Source Connection ID MUST be copied from the
     Destination Connection ID of the received packet, which is initially
     randomly selected by a client.  Echoing both connection IDs gives
     clients some assurance that the server received the packet and that
     the Version Negotiation packet was not generated by an entity that
     did not observe the Initial packet.

  서버는 대상 연결 ID 필드에서 수신하는 패킷의 소스 연결 ID 필드 값을 포함해야 합니다. 소스 연결 ID 값은 클라이언트가 처음에 무작위로 선택한 수신 패킷의 대상 연결 ID에서 복사되어야 합니다. 두 연결 ID를 모두 에코하면 클라이언트는 서버가 패킷을 수신했고 버전 협상 패킷이 초기 패킷을 관찰하지 않은 엔터티에 의해 생성되지 않았다는 확신을 갖게 됩니다.
