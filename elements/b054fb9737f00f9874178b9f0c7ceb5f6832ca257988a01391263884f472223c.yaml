          Distance from root
              The link state cost of the current set of shortest paths
              from the root to the vertex.  The link state cost of a path
              is calculated as the sum of the costs of the path's
              constituent links (as advertised in router-LSAs and
              network-LSAs).  One path is said to be "shorter" than
              another if it has a smaller link state cost.
