              AS-external-LSAs describe routes to destinations external to
              the Autonomous System.  Most AS-external-LSAs describe
              routes to specific external destinations; in these cases the
              LSA's Link State ID is set to the destination network's IP
              address (if necessary, the Link State ID can also have one
              or more of the network's "host" bits set; see Appendix E for
              details).  However, a default route for the Autonomous
              System can be described in an AS-external-LSA by setting the
              LSA's Link State ID to DefaultDestination (0.0.0.0).  AS-
              external-LSAs are originated by AS boundary routers.  An AS
              boundary router originates a single AS-external-LSA for each
              external route that it has learned, either through another
              routing protocol (such as BGP), or through configuration
              information.
