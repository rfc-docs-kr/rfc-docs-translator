          The IP destination address for the packet is selected as
          follows.  On physical point-to-point networks, the IP
          destination is always set to the address AllSPFRouters.  On all
          other network types (including virtual links), the majority of
          OSPF packets are sent as unicasts, i.e., sent directly to the
          other end of the adjacency.  In this case, the IP destination is
          just the Neighbor IP address associated with the other end of
          the adjacency (see Section 10).  The only packets not sent as
          unicasts are on broadcast networks; on these networks Hello
          packets are sent to the multicast destination AllSPFRouters, the
          Designated Router and its Backup send both Link State Update
