            As discussed in Section 5, changing the source B4's IPv6
            address may be used as an attack vector.  Packets with a new
            B4's IPv6 address from the same prefix SHOULD be rate-limited.
            It is RECOMMENDED to set this rate limit to 30 minutes; other
            values can be set on a per-deployment basis.
