     The definition of a multirate shaper requires multiple
     diffServMaxRateEntries.  In this case, an algorithm such as [SHAPER]
     is used.  In that algorithm, more than one rate is specified, and at
     any given time traffic is shaped to the lowest specified rate which
     exceeds the arrival rate of traffic.
