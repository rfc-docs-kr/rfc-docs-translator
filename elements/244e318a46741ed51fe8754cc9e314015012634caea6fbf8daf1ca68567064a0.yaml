     The following section describes a flow chart for most of the MSP.  A
     distinction is made between calls made by local processes called SEND
     and RECEIVE, and messages coming in over the NET called IN and OUT.
     An additional distinction is made between calls (or messages) with a
     local rendezvous and those with a foreign rendezvous Host.

  다음 섹션에서는 대부분의 MSP에 대한 흐름도를 설명합니다. SEND 및 RECEIVE라는 로컬 프로세스에 의해 이루어진 호출과 IN 및 OUT이라는 NET을 통해 들어오는 메시지가 구별됩니다. 지역 랑데뷰를 통한 통화(또는 메시지)와 해외 랑데뷰 호스트를 통한 통화(또는 메시지) 간에는 추가적인 차이가 있습니다.
