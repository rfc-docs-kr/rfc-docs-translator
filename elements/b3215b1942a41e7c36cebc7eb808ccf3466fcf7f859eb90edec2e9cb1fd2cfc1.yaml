     (a) An unspecified Local or Remote descriptor is considered to be a
     missing mandatory parameter.  It requires the MG to use whatever was
     last specified for that descriptor.  It is possible that there was no
     previously-specified value, in which case the descriptor concerned is
     ignored in further processing of the command.
