          o   The Designated Router originates a network-LSA on behalf of
              the network.  This LSA lists the set of routers (including
              the Designated Router itself) currently attached to the
              network.  The Link State ID for this LSA (see Section
              12.1.4) is the IP interface address of the Designated
              Router.  The IP network number can then be obtained by using
              the network's subnet/network mask.
