       the Internet Protocol but has some serious omissions (e.g., the
       mandatory subnet extension [IP:3] and the optional multicasting
       extension [IP:4]).  It is also out of date.  If there is a
       conflict, RFC-791, RFC-792, and RFC-950 must be taken as
       authoritative, while the present document is authoritative over
       all.
