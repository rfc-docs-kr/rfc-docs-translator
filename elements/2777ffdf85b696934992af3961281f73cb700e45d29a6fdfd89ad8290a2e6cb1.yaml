     o  Implementations might not validate the server identity.  This
        validation typically amounts to matching the protocol-level server
        name with the certificate's Subject Alternative Name field.  Note:
        this same information is often also found in the Common Name part
        of the Distinguished Name, and some validators incorrectly
        retrieve it from there instead of from the Subject Alternative
        Name.
