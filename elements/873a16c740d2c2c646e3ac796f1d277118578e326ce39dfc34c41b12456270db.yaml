     A server MAY send capabilities automatically, by using the CAPABILITY
     response code in the initial PREAUTH or OK responses and by sending
     an updated CAPABILITY response code in the tagged OK response as part
     of a successful authentication.  It is unnecessary for a client to
     send a separate CAPABILITY command if it recognizes these automatic
     capabilities and there was no change to the TLS and/or authentication
     state since they were received.

  서버는 초기 PREAUTH 또는 OK 응답에서 CAPABILITY 응답 코드를 사용하고 성공적인 인증의 일부로 태그가 지정된 OK 응답에서 업데이트된 CAPABILITY 응답 코드를 보내 자동으로 기능을 보낼 수 있습니다.  클라이언트가 이러한 자동 기능을 인식하고 TLS 및/또는 인증 상태가 수신된 이후 변경되지 않은 경우 별도의 CAPABILITY 명령을 보낼 필요가 없습니다.
