     Performance evaluation using actual network deployments has the
     advantage of realistic workloads and reflects the environment where
     the service or protocol is to be deployed.  In the case of ICN,
     however, it is not currently clear what qualifies as a "realistic
     workload".  Trace-based analysis of ICN is in its infancy, and more
     work is needed towards defining characteristic workloads for ICN
     evaluation studies.  Accordingly, the experimental process and the
     evaluation methodology per se are actively being researched for
     different ICN architectures.  Numerous factors affect the
     experimental results, including the topology selected; the background
     traffic that an application is being subjected to; network conditions
     such as available link capacities, link delays, and loss-rate
     characteristics throughout the selected topology; failure and
     disruption patterns; node mobility; and the diversity of devices
     used.
