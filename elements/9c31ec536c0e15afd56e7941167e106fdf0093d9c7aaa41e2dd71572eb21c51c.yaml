     Result-Code AVP values that are used to report protocol errors MUST
     only be present in answer messages whose 'E' bit is set.  When a
     request message is received that causes a protocol error, an answer
     message is returned with the 'E' bit set, and the Result-Code AVP is
     set to the appropriate protocol error value.  As the answer is sent
     back towards the originator of the request, each proxy or relay agent
     MAY take action on the message.
