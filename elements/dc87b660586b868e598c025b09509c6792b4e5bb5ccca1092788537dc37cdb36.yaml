     Implementation Note: It is now known that remote timing-based attacks
                          on SSL are possible, at least when the client
                          and server are on the same LAN.  Accordingly,
                          implementations that use static RSA keys SHOULD
                          use RSA blinding or some other anti-timing
                          technique, as described in [TIMING].
