     For shared configurations, this feature can cause other configuration
     changes (for example, via other NETCONF sessions) to be inadvertently
     altered or removed, unless the configuration locking feature is used
     (in other words, the lock is obtained before the <edit-config>
     operation is started).  Therefore, it is strongly suggested that in
     order to use this feature with shared configuration datastores,
     configuration locking also be used.
