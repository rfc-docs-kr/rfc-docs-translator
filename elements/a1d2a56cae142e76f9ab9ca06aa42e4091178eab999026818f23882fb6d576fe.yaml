          One of the functions of the calculation in Section 16.3 is to
          determine the actual next hop(s) for those destinations whose
          next hop was calculated as a virtual link in Sections 16.1 and
          16.2.  After completion of the calculation in Section 16.3, any
          paths calculated in Sections 16.1 and 16.2 that still have
          unresolved virtual next hops should be discarded.
