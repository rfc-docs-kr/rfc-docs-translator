      o   The cost of a virtual link is NOT configured.  It is defined to
          be the cost of the intra-area path between the two defining area
          border routers.  This cost appears in the virtual link's
          corresponding routing table entry.  When the cost of a virtual
          link changes, a new router-LSA should be originated for the
          backbone area.
