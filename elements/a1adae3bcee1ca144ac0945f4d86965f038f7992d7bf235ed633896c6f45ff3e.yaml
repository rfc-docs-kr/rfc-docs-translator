      o   A non-backbone area can carry transit data traffic (i.e., is
          considered a "transit area") if and only if it serves as the
          Transit area for one or more fully adjacent virtual links (see
          TransitCapability in Sections 6 and 16.1). Such an area requires
          special treatment when summarizing backbone networks into it
          (see Section 12.4.3), and during the routing calculation (see
          Section 16.3).
