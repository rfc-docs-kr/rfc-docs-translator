        In the short term, due to the rapid growth and increased
        commercialization of the Internet, it is possible that the
        topology may be relatively volatile. This implies that planning
        for address transition is very important. Fortunately, there are a
        number of steps which can be taken to help ease the effort
        required for address transition. A complete description of address
        transition issues is outside of the scope of this paper. However,
        a very brief outline of some transition issues is contained in
        this section.
