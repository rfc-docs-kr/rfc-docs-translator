          The routing table lookup algorithm in Section 11.1 has been
          modified to reflect current practice. The "best match" routing
          table entry is now always selected to be the one providing the
          most specific (longest) match. Suppose for example a router is
          forwarding packets to the destination 192.9.1.1. A routing table
          entry for 192.9.1/24 will always be a better match than the
          routing table entry for 192.9/16, regardless of the routing
          table entries' path-types. Note however that when multiple paths
