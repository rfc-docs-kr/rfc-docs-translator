     token_type_hint  OPTIONAL.  A hint about the type of the token
             submitted for revocation.  Clients MAY pass this parameter in
             order to help the authorization server to optimize the token
             lookup.  If the server is unable to locate the token using
             the given hint, it MUST extend its search across all of its
             supported token types.  An authorization server MAY ignore
             this parameter, particularly if it is able to detect the
             token type automatically.  This specification defines two
             such values:
