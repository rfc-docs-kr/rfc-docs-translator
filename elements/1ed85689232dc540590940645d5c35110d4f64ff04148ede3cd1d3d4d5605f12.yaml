     Mail Submission Servers and Mail Access Servers MAY implement client
     certificate authentication on the Implicit TLS port.  Such servers
     MUST NOT request a client certificate during the TLS handshake unless
     the server is configured to accept some client certificates as
     sufficient for authentication and the server has the ability to
     determine a mail server authorization identity matching such
     certificates.  How to make this determination is presently
     implementation specific.
