   *  Description:
   *      This file implements the Secure Hash Algorithms
   *      as defined in the U.S. National Institute of Standards
   *      and Technology Federal Information Processing Standards
   *      Publication (FIPS PUB) 180-3 published in October 2008
   *      and formerly defined in its predecessors, FIPS PUB 180-1
   *      and FIP PUB 180-2.
   *
   *      A combined document showing all algorithms is available at
   *              http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/
   *                     fips180-3/fips180-3_final.pdf
   *
   *      The five hashes are defined in these sizes:
   *              SHA-1           20 byte / 160 bit
   *              SHA-224         28 byte / 224 bit
   *              SHA-256         32 byte / 256 bit
   *              SHA-384         48 byte / 384 bit
   *              SHA-512         64 byte / 512 bit
