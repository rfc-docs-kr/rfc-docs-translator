     The M3UA layer on the SGP maintains the state of each remote ASP, in
     each Application Server that the ASP is configured to receive
     traffic, as input to the M3UA message distribution function.
     Similarly, where IPSPs use M3UA in a point-to-point fashion, the M3UA
     layer in an IPSP maintains the state of remote IPSPs.
