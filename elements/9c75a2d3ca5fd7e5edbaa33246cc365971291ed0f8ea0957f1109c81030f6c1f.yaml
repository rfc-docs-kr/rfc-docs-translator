     Additionally, if the lower layer performs ciphersuite negotiation, it
     should be understood that EAP does not provide by itself integrity
     protection of that negotiation.  Therefore, in order to avoid
     downgrading attacks which would lead to weaker ciphersuites being
     used, clients implementing lower layer ciphersuite negotiation SHOULD
     protect against negotiation downgrading.
