     If the AS_PATH attribute of a BGP route contains an AS loop, the BGP
     route should be excluded from the Phase 2 decision function.  AS loop
     detection is done by scanning the full AS path (as specified in the
     AS_PATH attribute), and checking that the autonomous system number of
     the local system does not appear in the AS path.  Operations of a BGP
     speaker that is configured to accept routes with its own autonomous
     system number in the AS path are outside the scope of this document.

  BGP 경로의 AS_PATH 속성에 AS 루프가 포함된 경우 BGP 경로는 2단계 결정 기능에서 제외되어야 합니다. AS 루프 감지는 전체 AS 경로(AS_PATH 속성에 지정된 대로)를 스캔하고 로컬 시스템의 자율 시스템 번호가 AS 경로에 나타나지 않는지 확인하여 수행됩니다. AS 경로에서 자체 자율 시스템 번호가 있는 경로를 허용하도록 구성된 BGP 스피커의 작동은 이 문서의 범위를 벗어납니다.
