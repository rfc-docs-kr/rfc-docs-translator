          List of all other attached routers
              The list of all other routers attached to the NBMA network.
              Each router is listed by its IP interface address on the
              network.  Also, for each router listed, that router's
              eligibility to become Designated Router must be defined.
              When an interface to a NBMA network comes up, the router
              sends Hello Packets only to those neighbors eligible to
              become Designated Router, until the identity of the
              Designated Router is discovered.
