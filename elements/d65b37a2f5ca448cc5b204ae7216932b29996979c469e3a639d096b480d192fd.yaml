        o  Trials are inexpensive.  DNAv4 performs its checks using small
           unicast packets.  An IPv4 ARP packet on Ethernet is just 42
           octets, including the Ethernet header.  This means that the
           cost of an unsuccessful attempt is small, whereas the cost of a
           missed opportunity (having the right address available as a
           candidate and choosing not to try it for some reason) is large.
           As a result, the best strategy is often to try all available
           candidate configurations, rather than try to determine which
           candidates, if any, may be correct for this link, based on
           heuristics or hints.  For a heuristic to offer the prospect of
           being a potentially useful way to eliminate inappropriate
           configurations from the candidate list, that heuristic has to
           (a) be fast and inexpensive to compute, as compared to sending
           a 42-octet unicast packet, and (b) have high probability of not
           falsely eliminating a candidate configuration that could be
           found to be the correct one.
