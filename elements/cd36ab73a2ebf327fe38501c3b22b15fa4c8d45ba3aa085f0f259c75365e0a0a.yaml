        There does not appear to be a strong case for direct providers to
        take their address spaces from the the IP space of an indirect
        provider (e.g., backbone). The benefit in routing data abstraction
        is relatively small. The number of direct providers today is in
        the tens and an order of magnitude increase would not cause an
        undue burden on the backbones.  Also, it may be expected that as
        time goes by there will be increased direct interconnection of the
        direct providers, leaf routing domains directly attached to the
        backbones, and international links directly attached to the
        providers. Under these circumstances, the distinction between
        direct and indirect providers may become blurred.
