      The flooding procedure starts when a Link State Update packet has
      been received.  Many consistency checks have been made on the
      received packet before being handed to the flooding procedure (see
      Section 8.2).  In particular, the Link State Update packet has been
      associated with a particular neighbor, and a particular area.  If
      the neighbor is in a lesser state than Exchange, the packet should
      be dropped without further processing.
