     The following is a description of the properties of realms supported
     by Twice-NAT. Network address of hosts in external network are unique
     in external networks, but not within private network.  Likewise, the
     network address of hosts in private network are unique only within
     the private network. In other words, the address space used in
     private network to locate hosts in private and public networks is
     unrelated to the address space used in public network to locate hosts
     in private and public networks.  Twice NAT would not be allowed to
     advertise local networks to the external network or vice versa.
