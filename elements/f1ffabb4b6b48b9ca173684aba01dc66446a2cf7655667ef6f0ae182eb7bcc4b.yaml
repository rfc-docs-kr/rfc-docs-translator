        "Unsupported Extension" is a fatal error sent due to lack of
        support for an extension such as Disconnect and/or CoA packets.
        This will typically be sent by a proxy receiving an ICMP port
        unreachable message after attempting to forward a CoA-Request or
        Disconnect-Request to the NAS.
