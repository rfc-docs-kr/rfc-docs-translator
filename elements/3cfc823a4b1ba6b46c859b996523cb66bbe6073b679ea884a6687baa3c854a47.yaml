  -- Minimum Rate Parameters Table
  --
  -- The parameters used by a scheduler for its inputs or outputs are
  -- maintained separately from the Queue or Scheduler table entries for
  -- reusability reasons and so that they may be used by both queues and
  -- schedulers.  This follows the approach for separation of data path
  -- elements from parameterization that is used throughout this MIB.
  -- Use of these Minimum Rate Parameter Table entries by Queues and
  -- Schedulers allows the modeling of hierarchical scheduling systems.
  --
  -- Specifically, a Scheduler has one or more inputs and one output.
  -- Any queue feeding a scheduler, or any scheduler which feeds a second
  -- scheduler, might specify a minimum transfer rate by pointing to an
  -- Minimum Rate Parameter Table entry.
  --
  -- The diffServMinRatePriority/Abs/Rel attributes are used as
  -- parameters to the work-conserving portion of a scheduler:
  -- "work-conserving" implies that the scheduler can continue to emit
  -- data as long as there is data available at its input(s).  This has
  -- the effect of guaranteeing a certain priority relative to other
  -- scheduler inputs and/or a certain minimum proportion of the
  -- available output bandwidth. Properly configured, this means a
  -- certain minimum rate, which may be exceeded should traffic be
  -- available should there be spare bandwidth after all other classes
  -- have had opportunities to consume their own minimum rates.
