     UDP-tunneled candidates can be encoded in the ICE offer and answer
     either as relayed or server reflexive candidates, depending on
     whether the tunneling protocol utilizes a relay between the hosts.
     The UDP-tunneled candidates may appear to applications as host
     candidates from a local pseudo-interface.  Treating these candidates
     as host candidates results in incorrect prioritization and possibly
     non-optimal candidate selection.  Implementations may attempt to
     detect pseudo-interfaces, e.g., from the address prefix of the
     interface, but detection details vary from technique to technique.
