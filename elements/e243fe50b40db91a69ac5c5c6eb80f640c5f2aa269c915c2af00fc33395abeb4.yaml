     When an ASP becomes active for an AS and the SG is experiencing SS7
     network isolation or is performing the MTP Restart procedure for the
     AS, the SG MAY send a DUNA message for the concerned destinations to
     the newly active ASP to prevent the ASP from sending traffic.  These
     messages can be sent after receiving the ASP Active, and before
     sending the ASP Active Ack, to ensure that traffic is not initiated
     by the ASP to these destinations before the SSNM are received.  In
     addition to DUNA messages, SCON, DRST, and DAVA can also be sent.
