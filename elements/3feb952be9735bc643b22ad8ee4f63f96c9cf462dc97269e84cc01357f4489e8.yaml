        Tutorial: Some internetwork applications need only datagram
        integrity, but others require that an entire stream of packets be
        protected against insertion, reordering, deletion, and delay:
        -  "Insertion": The destination receives an additional packet that
           was not sent by the source.
        -  "Reordering": The destination receives packets in a different
           order than that in which they were sent by the source.
        -  "Deletion": A packet sent by the source is not ever delivered
           to the intended destination.
        -  "Delay": A packet is detained for some period of time at a
           relay, thus hampering and postponing the packet's normal timely
           delivery from source to destination.

  - 튜토리얼: 일부 인터네트워크 애플리케이션에는 데이터그램 무결성만 필요하지만 다른 애플리케이션에서는 삽입, 재정렬, 삭제 및 지연으로부터 전체 패킷 스트림을 보호해야 합니다. - "삽입": 대상은 소스에서 전송되지 않은 추가 패킷을 수신합니다. . - "재정렬": 대상은 소스에서 보낸 순서와 다른 순서로 패킷을 수신합니다. - "삭제": 소스에서 보낸 패킷이 의도한 대상으로 전달되지 않습니다. - "지연": 패킷이 중계기에서 일정 시간 동안 유지되어 원본에서 대상까지 패킷의 정상적인 적시 전달을 방해하고 연기합니다.
