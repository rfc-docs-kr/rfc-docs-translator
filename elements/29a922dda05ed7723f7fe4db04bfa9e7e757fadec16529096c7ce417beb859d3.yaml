                  By default, if a network is not contained in any
                  explicitly configured address range, a Type 3 summary-
                  LSA is generated with Link State ID equal to the
                  network's address (if necessary, the Link State ID can
                  also have one or more of the network's "host" bits set;
                  see Appendix E for details) and metric equal to the
                  network's routing table cost.
