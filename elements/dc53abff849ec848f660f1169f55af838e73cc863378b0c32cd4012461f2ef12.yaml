        Another level of hierarchy may also be used in this addressing
        scheme to further reduce the amount of routing information
        necessary for inter-continental routing.  Continental aggregation
        is useful because continental boundaries provide natural barriers
        to topological connection and administrative boundaries.  Thus, it
        presents a natural boundary for another level of aggregation of
        inter-domain routing information.  To make use of this, it is
        necessary that each continent be assigned an appropriate subset of
        the address space.  Providers (both direct and indirect) within
        that continent would allocate their addresses from this space.
        Note that there are numerous exceptions to this, in which a
        service provider (either direct or indirect) spans a continental
        division.  These exceptions can be handled similarly to multi-
        homed routing domains, as discussed above.
