           It is generally desirable to avoid local fragmentation and to
           choose EMTU_S low enough to avoid fragmentation in any gateway
           along the path.  In the absence of actual knowledge of the
           minimum MTU along the path, the IP layer SHOULD use
           EMTU_S <= 576 whenever the destination address is not on a
           connected network, and otherwise use the connected network's
