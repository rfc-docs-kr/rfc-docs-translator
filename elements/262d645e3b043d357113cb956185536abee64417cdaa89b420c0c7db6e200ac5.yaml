        Also note that a UID range of 559:* always includes the UID of the
        last message in the mailbox, even if 559 is higher than any
        assigned UID value.  This is because the contents of a range are
        independent of the order of the range endpoints.  Thus, any UID
        range with * as one of the endpoints indicates at least one
        message (the message with the highest numbered UID), unless the
        mailbox is empty.

  - 또한 559:*의 UID 범위에는 559가 할당된 UID 값보다 높은 경우에도 항상 사서함에 있는 마지막 메시지의 UID가 포함됩니다.  이는 범위의 내용이 범위 끝점의 순서와 무관하기 때문입니다.  따라서 끝점 중 하나로 *가 있는 UID 범위는 사서함이 비어 있지 않은 한 최소한 하나의 메시지(UID 번호가 가장 높은 메시지)를 나타냅니다.
