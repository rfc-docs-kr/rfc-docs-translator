     The EMSK is reserved for future use and MUST remain on the EAP peer
     and EAP server where it is derived; it MUST NOT be transported to, or
     shared with, additional parties, or used to derive any other keys.
     (This restriction will be relaxed in a future document that specifies
     how the EMSK can be used.)
