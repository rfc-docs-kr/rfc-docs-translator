          As an example of Type 1 external metric processing, suppose that
          the Routers RT7 and RT5 in Figure 2 are advertising Type 1
          external metrics.  For each advertised external route, the total
          cost from Router RT6 is calculated as the sum of the external
          route's advertised cost and the distance from Router RT6 to the
          advertising router.  When two routers are advertising the same
          external destination, RT6 picks the advertising router providing
          the minimum total cost. RT6 then sets the next hop to the
          external destination equal to the next hop that would be used
          when routing packets to the chosen advertising router.
