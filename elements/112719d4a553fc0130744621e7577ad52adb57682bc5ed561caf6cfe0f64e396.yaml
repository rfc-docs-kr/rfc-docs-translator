     A relay or proxy agent MAY include the Proxy-Info AVP in requests if
     it requires access to any local state information when the
     corresponding response is received.  The Proxy-Info AVP has security
     implications as state information is distributed to other entities.
     As such, it is RECOMMENDED that the content of the Proxy-Info AVP be
     protected with cryptographic mechanisms, for example, by using a
     keyed message digest such as HMAC-SHA1 [RFC2104].  Such a mechanism,
     however, requires the management of keys, although only locally at
     the Diameter server.  Still, a full description of the management of
     the keys used to protect the Proxy-Info AVP is beyond the scope of
     this document.  Below is a list of common recommendations:
