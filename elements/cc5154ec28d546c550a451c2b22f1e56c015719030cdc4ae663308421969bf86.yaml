     AS-ACTIVE: The Application Server is available and application
     traffic is active.  The AS moves to this state after being in AS-
     INACTIVE and getting n ASPs (n is the number of ASPs required to be
     in ASP-ACTIVE state before AS can transition to AS-ACTIVE; n = 1 for
     Override Traffic Mode) in ASP-ACTIVE state or after reaching AS-
     ACTIVE and keeping one or more ASPs in ASP-ACTIVE state.  When one
     ASP is considered enough to handle traffic (smooth start), the AS in
     AS-INACTIVE MAY reach the AS-ACTIVE as soon as the first ASP moves to
     the ASP-ACTIVE state.
