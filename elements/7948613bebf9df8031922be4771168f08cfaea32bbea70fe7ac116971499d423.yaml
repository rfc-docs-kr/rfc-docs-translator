        If a proxy were to resubmit a request adding a Proxy-Authorization
        header field value, it would need to increment the CSeq in the new
        request.  However, this would cause the UAC that submitted the
        original request to discard a response from the UAS, as the CSeq
        value would be different.

  - 프록시가 Proxy-Authorization 헤더 필드 값을 추가하여 요청을 다시 제출하는 경우 새 요청에서 CSeq를 증가시켜야 합니다. 그러나 이렇게 하면 원래 요청을 제출한 UAC가 CSeq 값이 다르기 때문에 UAS의 응답을 삭제하게 됩니다.
