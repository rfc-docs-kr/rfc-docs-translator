     Within this document, authenticator requirements apply regardless of
     whether the authenticator is operating as a pass-through or not.
     Where the requirement is meant to apply to either the authenticator
     or backend authentication server, depending on where the EAP
     authentication is terminated, the term "EAP server" will be used.
