        If the old TRD (NorthSouthNet) and the new TRD (NewCommercialNet)
        are adjacent and cooperative, then this transition is easy to
        accomplish.  In this case, packets routed to the XYZ Corporation
        using the old address assignment could be routed to the
        NorthSouthNet, which would directly forward them to the
        NewCommercialNet, which would in turn forward them to XYZ
        Corporation. In this case only NorthSouthNet and NewCommercialNet
        need be aware of the fact that the old address refers to a
        destination which is no longer directly attached to NorthSouthNet.
