     A dynamically discovered peer causes an entry in the peer table (see
     Section 2.6) to be created.  Note that entries created via DNS MUST
     expire (or be refreshed) within the DNS Time to Live (TTL).  If a
     peer is discovered outside of the local realm, a routing table entry
     (see Section 2.7) for the peer's realm is created.  The routing table
     entry's expiration MUST match the peer's expiration value.
