        (i)  initial-excluded-subtrees, which indicates for each name type
             (e.g., X.500 distinguished names, email addresses, or IP
             addresses) a set of subtrees within which no subject name in
             any certificate in the certification path may fall.  The
             initial-excluded-subtrees input includes a set for each name
             type.  For each name type, the set may be empty or may
             consist of one or more subtrees that each specifies a subset
             of the names of that name type.  If the set for a name type
             is empty, then no names of that name type are excluded.
