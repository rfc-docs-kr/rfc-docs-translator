     It is possible to use the Ethernet link level protocol [12] on the
     same physical cable with the IEEE 802.3 link level protocol.  A
     computer interfaced to a physical cable used in this way could
     potentially read both Ethernet and 802.3 packets from the network.
     If a computer does read both types of packets, it must keep track of
     which link protocol was used with each other computer on the network
     and use the proper link protocol when sending packets.
