     o  Message stream modification.  An attacker may delete one or more
        syslog messages from a series of messages, replay a message, or
        alter the delivery sequence.  The syslog protocol itself is not
        based on message order.  However, an event in a syslog message may
        relate semantically to events in other messages, so message
        ordering may be important to understanding a sequence of events.
