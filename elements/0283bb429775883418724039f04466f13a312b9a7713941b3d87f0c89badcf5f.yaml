     [d] A AAA-Key derived from the MSK and/or EMSK negotiated between the
         peer and authentication server MAY be transmitted to the
         authenticator.  Therefore, a mechanism needs to be provided to
         transmit the AAA-Key from the authentication server to the
         authenticator that needs it.  The specification of the AAA-key
         derivation, transport, and wrapping mechanisms is outside the
         scope of this document.  Further details on AAA-Key Derivation
         are provided within [KEYFRAME].
