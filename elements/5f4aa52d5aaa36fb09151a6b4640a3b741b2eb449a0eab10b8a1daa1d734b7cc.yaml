     Previous revisions of HTTP imposed an arbitrary 60-second limit on
     the determination of whether Last-Modified was a strong validator to
     guard against the possibility that the Date and Last-Modified values
     are generated from different clocks or at somewhat different times
     during the preparation of the response.  This specification has
     relaxed that to allow reasonable discretion.  (Section 8.8.2.2)
