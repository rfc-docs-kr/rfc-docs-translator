     A packet arriving at an egress interface may have been classified on
     an ingress interface, and the egress interface may have access to
     that information.  If it is relevant, there is no reason not to use
     that information.  If it is not available, however, there may be a
     need to (re)classify on the egress interface.  In any event, it picks
     up its "program" from the diffServDataPathTable.  This points to a
     classifier, which will select traffic according to some specification
     for each traffic class.
