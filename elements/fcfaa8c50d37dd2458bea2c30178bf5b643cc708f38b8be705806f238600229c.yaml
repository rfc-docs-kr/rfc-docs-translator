     The algorithm field MUST be of a type advertised by the server in the
     "signature_algorithms" extension of the CertificateRequest message,
     and the dc_cert_verify_algorithm field MUST be of a type advertised
     by the server in the SignatureSchemeList; otherwise, the credential
     is considered not valid.  Servers that receive non-valid delegated
     credentials MUST terminate the connection with an "illegal_parameter"
     alert.
