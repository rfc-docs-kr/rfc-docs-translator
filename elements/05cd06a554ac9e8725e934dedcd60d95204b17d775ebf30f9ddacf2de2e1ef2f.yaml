     To simplify management creation and deletion of rows in this MIB, the
     agent is expected to assist in maintaining its consistency.  It may
     accomplish this by maintaining internal usage counters for any row
     that might be pointed to by a RowPointer, or by any equivalent means.
     When a RowPointer is created or written, and the row it points to
     does not exist, the SET returns an inconsistentValue error.  When a
     RowStatus variable is set to 'destroy' but the usage counter is non-
     zero, the SET returns no error but the indicated row is left intact.
     The agent should later remove the row in the event that the usage
     counter becomes zero.
