     A confirmed <commit> operation MUST be reverted if a confirming
     commit is not issued within the timeout period (by default 600
     seconds = 10 minutes).  The confirming commit is a <commit> operation
     without the <confirmed> parameter.  The timeout period can be
     adjusted with the <confirm-timeout> parameter.  If a follow-up
     confirmed <commit> operation is issued before the timer expires, the
     timer is reset to the new value (600 seconds by default).  Both the
     confirming commit and a follow-up confirmed <commit> operation MAY
     introduce additional changes to the configuration.
