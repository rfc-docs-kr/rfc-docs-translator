     For reliable transports, the response is normally sent on the
     connection on which the request was received.  Therefore, the client
     transport MUST be prepared to receive the response on the same
     connection used to send the request.  Under error conditions, the
     server may attempt to open a new connection to send the response.  To
     handle this case, the transport layer MUST also be prepared to

     the request was sent and port number in the "sent-by" field.  It also

  안정적인 전송을 위해 응답은 일반적으로 요청이 수신된 연결에서 전송됩니다. 따라서 클라이언트 전송은 요청을 보내는 데 사용된 것과 동일한 연결에서 응답을 수신할 준비를 해야 합니다. 오류 상황에서 서버는 응답을 보내기 위해 새 연결을 열려고 시도할 수 있습니다. 이 경우를 처리하려면 전송 계층도 요청이 전송된 소스 IP 주소와 "sent-by" 필드의 포트 번호에서 들어오는 연결을 수신할 준비를 해야 합니다. 또한
