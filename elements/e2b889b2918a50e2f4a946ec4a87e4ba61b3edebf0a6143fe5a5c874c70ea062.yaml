     Thus far, two independent interoperable implementations of Minimal
     Canonicalization have not been announced.  Therefore, when "XML-
     Signature Syntax and Processing" was advanced along the Standards
     Track from [RFC3075] to [RFC3275], Minimal Canonicalization was
     dropped.  However, there was still interest.  For its definition, see
     Section 6.5.1 of [RFC3075].

  지금까지 최소 정규화의 두 가지 독립적인 상호 운용 가능한 구현은 발표되지 않았습니다. 따라서 "XML-서명 구문 및 처리"가 표준 트랙을 따라 [RFC3075]에서 [RFC3275]로 발전했을 때 최소 정규화는 삭제되었습니다. 그러나 여전히 관심이 있었습니다. 해당 정의는 [RFC3075]의 섹션 6.5.1을 참조하세요.
