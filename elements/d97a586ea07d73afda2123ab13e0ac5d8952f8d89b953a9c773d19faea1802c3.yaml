          It is a common occurrence for a router to receive self-
          originated LSAs via the flooding procedure. A self-originated
          LSA is detected when either 1) the LSA's Advertising Router is
          equal to the router's own Router ID or 2) the LSA is a network-
          LSA and its Link State ID is equal to one of the router's own IP
          interface addresses.
