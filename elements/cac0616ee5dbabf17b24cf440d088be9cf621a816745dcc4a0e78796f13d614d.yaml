      bit E
          The type of external metric.  If bit E is set, the metric
          specified is a Type 2 external metric.  This means the metric is
          considered larger than any link state path.  If bit E is zero,
          the specified metric is a Type 1 external metric.  This means
          that it is expressed in the same units as the link state metric
          (i.e., the same units as interface cost).
