     The calculation of a smoothed queue length may also have an important
     bearing on the behavior of the dropper: parameters may include the
     sampling interval or rate, and the weight of each sample.  The
     performance may be very sensitive to the values of these parameters
     and a wide range of possible values may be required due to a wide
     range of link speeds.  Most algorithms include a sample weight,
     represented here by diffServRandomDropWeight.  The availability of
     diffServRandomDropSamplingRate as readable is important, the
     information provided by Sampling Rate is essential to the
     configuration of diffServRandomDropWeight.  Having Sampling Rate be
     configurable is also helpful, as line speed increases, the ability to
     have queue sampling be less frequent than packet arrival is needed.
     Note, however, that there is ongoing research on this topic, see e.g.
     [ACTQMGMT] and [AQMROUTER].
