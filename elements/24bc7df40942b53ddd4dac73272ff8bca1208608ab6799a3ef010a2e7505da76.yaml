        The <lock> operation takes a mandatory parameter, <target>.  The
        <target> parameter names the configuration datastore that will be
        locked.  When a lock is active, using the <edit-config> operation
        on the locked configuration datastore and using the locked
        configuration as a target of the <copy-config> operation will be
        disallowed by any other NETCONF session.  Additionally, the system
        will ensure that these locked configuration resources will not be
        modified by other non-NETCONF management operations such as SNMP
        and CLI.  The <kill-session> operation can be used to force the
        release of a lock owned by another NETCONF session.  It is beyond
        the scope of this document to define how to break locks held by
        other entities.
