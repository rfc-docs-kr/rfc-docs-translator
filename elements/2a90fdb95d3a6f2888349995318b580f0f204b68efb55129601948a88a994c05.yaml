                (c)  Hosts should ideally limit their EMTU_S for a given
                     destination to the minimum MTU of all the networks
                     along the path, to avoid any fragmentation.  IP
                     fragmentation, while formally correct, can create a
                     serious transport protocol performance problem,
                     because loss of a single fragment means all the
                     fragments in the segment must be retransmitted
                     [IP:9].
