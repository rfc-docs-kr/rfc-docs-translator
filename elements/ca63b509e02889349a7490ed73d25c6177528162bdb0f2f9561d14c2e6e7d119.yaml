     The Device-Watchdog-Request (DWR), indicated by the Command Code set
     to 280 and the Command Flags' 'R' bit set, is sent to a peer when no
     traffic has been exchanged between two peers (see Section 5.5.3).
     Upon detection of a transport failure, this message MUST NOT be sent
     to an alternate peer.
