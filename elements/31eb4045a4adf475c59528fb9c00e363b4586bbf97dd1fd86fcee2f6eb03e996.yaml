     Typically the AUTH, USER, PASS, PBSZ, and PROT commands would be
     protected within the TLS protocol and then the CCC command would be
     issued to return to a plaintext socket state.  This has important
     Security Issues (which are discussed in the Security Considerations
     section), but this document describes how the command should be used,
     if the client and server still wish to use it after having considered
     the issues.
