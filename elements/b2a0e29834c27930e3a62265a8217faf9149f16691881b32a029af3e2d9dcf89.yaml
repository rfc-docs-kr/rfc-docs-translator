     Note that the Reflector test packet formats are larger than the
     Sender's formats.  The Session-Sender MAY append sufficient Packet
     Padding to allow the same IP packet payload lengths to be used in
     each direction of transmission (this is usually desirable).  To
     compensate for the Reflector's larger test packet format, the Sender
     appends at least 27 octets of padding in unauthenticated mode, and at
     least 56 octets in authenticated and encrypted modes.
