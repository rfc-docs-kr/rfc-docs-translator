                   A static route is typically a particular preset mapping
                   from destination host or network into a particular
                   next-hop gateway; it might also depend on the Type-of-
                   Service (see next section).  Static routes would be set
                   up by system administrators to override the normal
                   automatic routing mechanism, to handle exceptional
                   situations.  However, any static routing information is
                   a potential source of failure as configurations change
                   or equipment fails.
