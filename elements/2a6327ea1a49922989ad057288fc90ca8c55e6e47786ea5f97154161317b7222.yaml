      Checksum
          The standard IP checksum of the entire contents of the packet,
          starting with the OSPF packet header but excluding the 64-bit
          authentication field.  This checksum is calculated as the 16-bit
          one's complement of the one's complement sum of all the 16-bit
          words in the packet, excepting the authentication field.  If the
          packet's length is not an integral number of 16-bit words, the
          packet is padded with a byte of zero before checksumming.  The
          checksum is considered to be part of the packet authentication
          procedure; for some authentication types the checksum
          calculation is omitted.
