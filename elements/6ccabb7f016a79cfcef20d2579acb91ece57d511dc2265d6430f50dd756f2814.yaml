     In the state table, the event "Failure to send X" means that the
     Diameter agent is unable to send command X to the desired
     destination.  This could be due to the peer being down or due to the
     peer sending back a transient failure or temporary protocol error
     notification DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY or DIAMETER_LOOP_DETECTED in the
     Result-Code AVP of the corresponding Answer command.  The event 'X
     successfully sent' is the complement of 'Failure to send X'.
