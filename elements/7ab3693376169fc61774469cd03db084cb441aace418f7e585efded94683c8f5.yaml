           UDP is almost a null protocol; the only services it provides
           over IP are checksumming of data and multiplexing by port
           number.  Therefore, an application program running over UDP
           must deal directly with end-to-end communication problems that
           a connection-oriented protocol would have handled -- e.g.,
           retransmission for reliable delivery, packetization and
           reassembly, flow control, congestion avoidance, etc., when
           these are required.  The fairly complex coupling between IP and
           TCP will be mirrored in the coupling between UDP and many
           applications using UDP.
