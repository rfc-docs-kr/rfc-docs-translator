     One use of a meter is when a service provider sells at most, a
     certain bit rate to one of its customers, and wants to drop the
     excess.  In such a case, the fractal nature of normal Internet
     traffic must be reflected in large burst intervals, as TCP frequently
     sends packet pairs or larger bursts, and responds poorly when more
     than one packet in a round trip interval is dropped.  Applications
     like FTP contain the effect by simply staying below the target bit
     rate; this type of configuration very adversely affects transaction
     applications like HTTP, however.  Another use of a meter is in the AF
     specification, in which excess traffic is marked with a related DSCP
     and subjected to slightly more active queue depth management.  The
