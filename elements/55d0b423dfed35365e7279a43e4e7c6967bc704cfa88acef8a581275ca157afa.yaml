     This protocol is being recommended for publication as an
     Informational RFC rather than as a standards-track RFC because of
     problems that cannot be fixed without creating incompatibilities with
     deployed implementations.  This includes security vulnerabilities, as
     well as semantic ambiguities resulting from the design of the
     Change-of-Authorization (CoA) commands.  While fixes are recommended,
     they cannot be made mandatory since this would be incompatible with
     existing implementations.
