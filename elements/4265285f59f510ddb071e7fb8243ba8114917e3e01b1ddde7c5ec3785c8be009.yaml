     Under normal circumstances, a routing domain (or "Autonomous System")
     that has been allocated or assigned a set of prefixes has sole
     responsibility for aggregation of those prefixes.  In the usual case,
     the AS will install configuration in one or more of its routers to
     generate aggregate routes based on more-specific routes known to its
     internal routing system.  These aggregate routes are advertised into
     the global routing system by the border routers for the routing
     domain.  The more-specific internal routes that overlap with the
     aggregate routes should not be advertised globally.  In some cases,
