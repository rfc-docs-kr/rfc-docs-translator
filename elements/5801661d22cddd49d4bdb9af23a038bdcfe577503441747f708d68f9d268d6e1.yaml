     Note that it is also possible for a TCP connection to terminate
     without the NAT device becoming aware of the event (e.g., in the case
     where one or both peers reboot). Consequently, garbage collection is
     necessary on NAT devices to clean up unused state about TCP sessions
     that no longer exist. However, it is not possible in the general case
     to distinguish between connections that have been idle for an
     extended period of time from those that no longer exist.  In the case
     of UDP-based sessions, there is no single way to determine when a
     session ends, since UDP-based protocols are application specific.
