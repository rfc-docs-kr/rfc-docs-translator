                Hosts wishing to receive trailer encapsulations send
                trailer ARP replies whenever they complete exchanges of
                normal ARP messages for IP.  Thus, a host that received an
                ARP request for its IP protocol address would send a
                trailer ARP reply in addition to the normal IP ARP reply;
                a host that sent the IP ARP request would send a trailer
                ARP reply when it received the corresponding IP ARP reply.
                In this way, either the requesting or responding host in
                an IP ARP exchange may request that it receive trailer
                encapsulations.
