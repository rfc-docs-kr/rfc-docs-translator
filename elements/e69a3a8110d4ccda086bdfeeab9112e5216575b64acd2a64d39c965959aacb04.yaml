                 b. For each P-OID in the user-initial-policy-set that is
                 not the valid_policy of a node in the
                 valid_policy_node_set, create a child node whose parent
                 is the node of depth n-1 with the valid_policy anyPolicy.
                 Set the values in the child node as follows: set the
                 valid_policy to P-OID; set the qualifier_set to P-Q; copy
                 the criticality_indicator from the node of depth n with
                 the valid_policy anyPolicy; and set the
                 expected_policy_set to {P-OID}.
