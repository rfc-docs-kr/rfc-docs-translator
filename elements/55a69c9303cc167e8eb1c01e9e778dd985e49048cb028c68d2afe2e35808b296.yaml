     An implementation following these rules should also be generalized,
     so that an arbitrary network number and mask are accepted for all
     routing destinations.  The only outstanding constraint is that the
     mask must be left contiguous.  Note that the degenerate route to
     prefix 0.0.0.0/0 is used as a default route and MUST be accepted by
     all implementations.  Further, to protect against accidental
     advertisements of this route via the inter-domain protocol, this
     route should only be advertised to another routing domain when a
     router is explicitly configured to do so, never as a non-configured,
     "default" option.
