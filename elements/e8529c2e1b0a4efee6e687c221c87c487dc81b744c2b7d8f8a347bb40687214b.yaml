     Where DNAv4 and DHCP are tried in parallel, one strategy is to
     forsake reachability test retransmissions and to allow only the DHCP
     client to retransmit.  In order to reduce competition between DNAv4
     and DHCP retransmissions, a DNAv4 implementation that retransmits may
     utilize the retransmission strategy described in Section 4.1 of the
     DHCP specification [RFC2131], scheduling DNAv4 retransmissions
     between DHCP retransmissions.
