     It has become clear that the first two of these problems are likely
     to become critical within the next one to three years.  This memo
     attempts to deal with these problems by proposing a mechanism to slow
     the growth of the routing table and the need for allocating new IP
     network numbers. It does not attempt to solve the third problem,
     which is of a more long-term nature, but instead endeavors to ease
     enough of the short to mid-term difficulties to allow the Internet to
     continue to function efficiently while progress is made on a longer-
     term solution.
