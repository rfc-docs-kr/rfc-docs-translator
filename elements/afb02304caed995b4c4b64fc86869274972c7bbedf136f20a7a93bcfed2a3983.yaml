                   A host may receive a Time Exceeded Code 1 (Reassembly
                   Timeout) message from a destination host that has timed
                   out and discarded an incomplete datagram; see Section
                   3.3.2 below.  In the future, receipt of this message
                   might be part of some "MTU discovery" procedure, to
                   discover the maximum datagram size that can be sent on
                   the path without fragmentation.
