      Router Priority
          An 8-bit unsigned integer.  When two routers attached to a
          network both attempt to become Designated Router, the one with
          the highest Router Priority takes precedence.  A router whose
          Router Priority is set to 0 is ineligible to become Designated
          Router on the attached network.  Advertised in Hello packets
