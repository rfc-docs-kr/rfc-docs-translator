              IP interface addresses on the Point-to-MultiPoint network.
              In the graphical representation of the link-state database,
              routers that can communicate directly over the Point-to-
              MultiPoint network are joined by bidirectional edges, and
              each router also has a stub connection to its own IP
              interface address (which is in contrast to the
              representation of real point-to-point links; see Figure 1a).
