     It is possible that the MGC could be implemented in such a way that a
     failed MGC is replaced by a working MGC where the identity of the new
     MGC is the same as the failed one.  In such a case,
     ServiceChangeMgcId would be specified with the previous value and the
     MG shall behave as if the value was changed, and send a ServiceChange
     message, as above.
