        For example, consider a single campus which is a leaf routing
        domain which would currently require 4 different IP networks.
        Under the new allocation scheme, they might instead be given a
        single prefix which provides the same number of destination
        addresses.  Further, since the prefix is a subset of the
        provider's prefix, they impose no additional burden on the higher
        levels of the routing hierarchy.
