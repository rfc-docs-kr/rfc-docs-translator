     receive window
             This represents the sequence numbers the local (receiving)
             TCP endpoint is willing to receive.  Thus, the local TCP
             endpoint considers that segments overlapping the range
             RCV.NXT to RCV.NXT + RCV.WND - 1 carry acceptable data or
             control.  Segments containing sequence numbers entirely
             outside this range are considered duplicates or injection
             attacks and discarded.
