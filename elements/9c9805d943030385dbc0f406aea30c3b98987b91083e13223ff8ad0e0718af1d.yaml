                      In the above example, the forwarding address field
                      has been set to 0.0.0.0, indicating that packets for
                      the external destination should be forwarded to the
                      advertising OSPF router (RT7).  This is not always
                      desirable.  Consider the example pictured in Figure
                      16.  There are three OSPF routers (RTA, RTB and RTC)
                      connected to a common network.  Only one of these
                      routers, RTA, is exchanging BGP information with the
                      non-OSPF router RTX.  RTA must then originate AS-
                      external-LSAs for those destinations it has learned
                      from RTX.  By using the AS-external-LSA's forwarding
                      address field, RTA can specify that packets for
                      these destinations be forwarded directly to RTX.
                      Without this feature, Routers RTB and RTC would take
                      an extra hop to get to these destinations.
