     Thus, delegated credentials should not be used to send a delegation
     to an untrusted party.  Rather, they are meant to be used between
     parties that have some trust relationship with each other.  The
     secrecy of the delegated credential's private key is thus important,

     file system controls, physical security, or hardware security
     modules.
