     A CER message is always sent on the initiating connection immediately
     after the connection request is successfully completed.  In the case
     of an election, one of the two connections will shut down.  The
     responder connection will survive if the Origin-Host of the local
     Diameter entity is higher than that of the peer; the initiator
     connection will survive if the peer's Origin-Host is higher.  All
     subsequent messages are sent on the surviving connection.  Note that
     the results of an election on one peer are guaranteed to be the
     inverse of the results on the other.
