          When the neighbor responds to these requests with the proper
          Link State Update packet(s), the Link state request list is
          truncated and a new Link State Request packet is sent.  This
          process continues until the Link state request list becomes
          empty. LSAs on the Link state request list that have been
          requested, but not yet received, are packaged into Link State
          Request packets for retransmission at intervals of RxmtInterval.
          There should be at most one Link State Request packet
          outstanding at any one time.
