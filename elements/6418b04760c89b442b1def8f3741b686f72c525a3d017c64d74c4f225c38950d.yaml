     The SCON message can be sent from an SGP to all concerned ASPs to
     indicate that an SG has determined that there is congestion in the
     SS7 network to one or more destinations, or to an ASP in response to
     a DATA or DAUD message, as appropriate.  For some MTP protocol
     variants (e.g., ANSI MTP) the SCON message may be sent when the SS7
     congestion level changes.  The SCON message MAY also be sent from the
     M3UA layer of an ASP to an M3UA peer, indicating that the congestion
     level of the M3UA layer or the ASP has changed.
