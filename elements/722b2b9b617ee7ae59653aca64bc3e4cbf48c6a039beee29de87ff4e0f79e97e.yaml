          (5) If this step is reached, the LSA must be flooded out the
              interface.  Send a Link State Update packet (including the
              new LSA as contents) out the interface.  The LSA's LS age
              must be incremented by InfTransDelay (which must be > 0)
              when it is copied into the outgoing Link State Update packet
              (until the LS age field reaches the maximum value of
              MaxAge).
