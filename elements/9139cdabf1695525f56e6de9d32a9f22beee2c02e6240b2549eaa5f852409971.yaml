     In the case of a Broadcast mode AS, receipt of an ASP Active message
     at an SGP or IPSP causes direction of traffic to the ASP sending the
     ASP Active message, in addition to all the other ASPs that are
     currently active in the AS.  The algorithm at the SGP for
     broadcasting traffic within an AS to all the active ASPs is a simple
     broadcast algorithm, where every message is sent to each of the
     active ASPs.
