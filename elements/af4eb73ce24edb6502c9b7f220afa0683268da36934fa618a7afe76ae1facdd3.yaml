     The Error-Reporting-Host AVP (AVP Code 294) is of type
     DiameterIdentity.  This AVP contains the identity of the Diameter
     host that sent the Result-Code AVP to a value other than 2001
     (Success), only if the host setting the Result-Code is different from
     the one encoded in the Origin-Host AVP.  This AVP is intended to be
     used for troubleshooting purposes, and it MUST be set when the
     Result-Code AVP indicates a failure.
