     Diameter implementations SHOULD first attempt to establish a TLS/TCP
     and DTLS/SCTP connection prior to the CER/CEA exchange.  This
     protects the capabilities information of both peers.  To support
     older Diameter implementations that do not fully conform to this
     document, the transport security MAY still be negotiated via an
     Inband-Security AVP.  In this case, the receiver of a Capabilities-
     Exchange-Request (CER) message that does not have any security
     mechanisms in common with the sender MUST return a Capabilities-
     Exchange-Answer (CEA) with the Result-Code AVP set to
     DIAMETER_NO_COMMON_SECURITY and SHOULD disconnect the transport layer
     connection.
