          Whenever a protocol packet is received by the router it is
          marked with the interface it was received on.  For routers that
          have virtual links configured, it may not be immediately obvious
          which interface to associate the packet with.  For example,
          consider the Router RT11 depicted in Figure 6.  If RT11 receives
          an OSPF protocol packet on its interface to Network N8, it may
          want to associate the packet with the interface to Area 2, or
          with the virtual link to Router RT10 (which is part of the
          backbone).  In the following, we assume that the packet is
          initially associated with the non-virtual  link.[3]
