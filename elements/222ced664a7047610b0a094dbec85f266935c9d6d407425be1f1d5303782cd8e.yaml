              This section explains how to calculate the current set of
              next hops to use for a destination.  Each next hop consists
              of the outgoing interface to use in forwarding packets to
              the destination together with the IP address of the next hop
              router (if any).  The next hop calculation is invoked each
              time a shorter path to the destination is discovered.  This
              can happen in either stage of the shortest-path tree
              calculation (see Section 16.1).  In stage 1 of the
              shortest-path tree calculation a shorter path is found as
              the destination is added to the candidate list, or when the
              destination's entry on the candidate list is modified (Step
              2d of Stage 1).  In stage 2 a shorter path is discovered
              each time the destination's routing table entry is modified
              (Step 2 of Stage 2).
