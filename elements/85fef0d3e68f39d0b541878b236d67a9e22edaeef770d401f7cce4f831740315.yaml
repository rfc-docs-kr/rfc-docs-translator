     The size of restart intervals SHOULD be chosen to always allow an
     integral number of restart intervals to fit within a single packet.
     This will guarantee that packets can be decoded independently from
     one another.  If a restart interval ends up being larger than a
     packet, the F and L bits in the Restart Marker header can be used to
     fragment it, but the resulting set of packets must all be received by
     a decoder for that restart interval to be decoded properly.
