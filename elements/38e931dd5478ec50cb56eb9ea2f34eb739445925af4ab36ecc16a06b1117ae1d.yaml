     The Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a
     distance vector IPv6 routing protocol designed for Low-Power and
     Lossy Networks (LLNs) [RFC6550].  Such networks are typically
     constrained in resources (limited communication data rate, processing
     power, energy capacity, memory).  In particular, some LLN
     configurations may utilize LLN routers where memory constraints limit
     nodes to maintaining only a small number of default routes and no
     other destinations.  However, it may be necessary to utilize such
     memory-constrained routers to forward datagrams and maintain
     reachability to destinations within the LLN.
