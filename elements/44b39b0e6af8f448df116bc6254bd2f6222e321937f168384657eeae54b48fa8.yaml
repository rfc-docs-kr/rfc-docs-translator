           The trailer protocol [LINK:1] for link-layer encapsulation MAY
           be used, but only when it has been verified that both systems
           (host or gateway) involved in the link-layer communication
           implement trailers.  If the system does not dynamically
           negotiate use of the trailer protocol on a per-destination
           basis, the default configuration MUST disable the protocol.
