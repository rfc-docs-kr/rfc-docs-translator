     Before an Internet-Draft can be published as an RFC, IANA needs to
     know what actions (if any) it needs to perform.  Experience has shown
     that it is not always immediately obvious whether a document has no
     IANA actions, without reviewing the document in some detail.  In

     documents should, after the authors confirm that this is the case,
     include an IANA Considerations section that states:

  인터넷 초안을 RFC로 게시하기 전에 IANA는 수행해야 할 작업(있는 경우)을 알아야 합니다. 경험에 따르면 문서를 세부적으로 검토하지 않으면 문서에 IANA 작업이 없는지 여부가 항상 즉각적으로 명확해지는 것은 아닙니다. 수행할 조치가 없음(그리고 작성자가 의식적으로 그러한 결정을 내림)을 IANA에 분명히 하기 위해 작성자가 이를 확인한 후 해당 문서에는 다음을 설명하는 IANA 고려사항 섹션을 포함해야 합니다.
