     In some environments the confidentiality of syslog data is not
     important, so messages are sent to any transport receiver.  To
     achieve this, the transport sender can skip transport receiver
     authentication (by accepting any certificate).  While this policy
     does authenticate and authorize the transport sender, it does not
     protect against the threat of transport receiver masquerade described
     in Section 2, leaving the data sent vulnerable to disclosure and
     modification.  The use of this policy is generally NOT RECOMMENDED
     for this reason.
