           o    Con: Gateway algorithms and protocols are still changing,
                and they will continue to change as the Internet system
                grows larger.  Attempting to include a general gateway
                function within the host IP layer will force host system
                maintainers to track these (more frequent) changes.  Also,
                a larger pool of gateway implementations will make
                coordinating the changes more difficult.  Finally, the
                complexity of a gateway IP layer is somewhat greater than
                that of a host, making the implementation and operation
                tasks more complex.
