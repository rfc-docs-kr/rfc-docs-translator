      This memo documents version 2 of the OSPF protocol.  OSPF is a
      link-state routing protocol.  It is designed to be run internal to a
      single Autonomous System.  Each OSPF router maintains an identical
      database describing the Autonomous System's topology.  From this
      database, a routing table is calculated by constructing a shortest-
      path tree.
