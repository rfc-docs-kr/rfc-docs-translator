      DESCRIPTION
         "The Queue Table enumerates the individual queues.  Note that the
         MIB models queuing systems as composed of individual queues, one
         per class of traffic, even though they may in fact be structured
         as classes of traffic scheduled using a common calendar queue, or
         in other ways."
