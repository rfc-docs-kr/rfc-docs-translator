     One could argue that the potential need for renumbering represents a
     significant drawback of using the addresses out of the block
     allocated for private internets.  However, we need to observe that
     the need is only "potential", since many hosts may never move into
     the third category, and an enterprise may never decide to
     interconnect (at IP level) with another enterprise.
