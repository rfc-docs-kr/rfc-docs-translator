     The onramp gateway SHOULD gather information about the GSTN fax
     sender address (for example, via Caller-ID, if available) and encode
     it as the sender of the Internet Fax, using the direct address
     mapping (see Section 4.2.2 of this document).  The sender address
     SHOULD be completed using the onramp gateway address, unless the
     onramp gateway has additional information with which to specify a
     different return path.
