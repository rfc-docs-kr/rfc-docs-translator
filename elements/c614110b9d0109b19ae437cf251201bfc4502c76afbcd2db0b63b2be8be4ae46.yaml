     The triple handshake attack [BhargavanDFPS14] enables the attacker to
     cause two TLS connections to share keying material.  This leads to a
     multitude of attacks, e.g., man-in-the-middle, breaking safe
     renegotiation, and breaking channel binding via TLS Exporter
     [RFC5705] or "tls-unique" [RFC5929].
