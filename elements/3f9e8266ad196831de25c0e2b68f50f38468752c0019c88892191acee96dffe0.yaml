        Are leaf routing domains willing to accept prefixes derived from
        the direct providers? In the supplier/consumer model, the direct
        provider is offering connectivity as the service, priced according
        to its costs of operation. This includes the "price" of obtaining
        service from one or more indirect providers (e.g., backbones). In
        general, indirect providers will want to handle as few address
        prefixes as possible to keep costs low. In the Internet
        environment, which does not operate as a typical marketplace, leaf
        routing domains must be sensitive to the resource constraints of
        the providers (both direct and indirect). The efficiencies gained
        in inter-domain routing clearly warrant the adoption of IP address
        prefixes derived from the IP address space of the providers.
