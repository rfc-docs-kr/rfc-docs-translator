     Either of the IPSPs can initiate communication.  When an IPSP
     receives an ASP Active, it should mark the peer as ASP-ACTIVE and
     return an ASP Active Ack message.  An ASP receiving an ASP Active Ack
     message may mark the peer as ASP-Active, if it is not already in the
     ASP-ACTIVE state.
