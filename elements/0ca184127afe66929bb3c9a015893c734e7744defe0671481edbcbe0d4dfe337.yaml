     ACK frames MUST only be carried in a packet that has the same packet
     number space as the packet being acknowledged; see Section 12.1.  For
     instance, packets that are protected with 1-RTT keys MUST be
     acknowledged in packets that are also protected with 1-RTT keys.

  ACK 프레임은 승인된 패킷과 동일한 패킷 번호 공간을 가진 패킷에서만 전달되어야 합니다. 섹션 12.1을 참조하세요. 예를 들어, 1-RTT 키로 보호되는 패킷은 1-RTT 키로도 보호되는 패킷에서 확인되어야 합니다.
