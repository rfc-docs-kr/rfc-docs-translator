     From the list of ASPs within the AS table, an ASP in the ASP-ACTIVE
     state is selected and a DATA message is constructed and issued on the
     corresponding SCTP association.  If more than one ASP is in the ASP-
     ACTIVE state (i.e., traffic is to be loadshared across more than one
     ASP), one of the ASPs in the ASP-ACTIVE state is selected from the
     list.  If the ASPs are in Broadcast Mode, all active ASPs will be
     selected, and the message will be sent to each of the active ASPs.
     The selection algorithm is implementation dependent but could, for
     example, be round robin or based on the SLS or ISUP CIC.  The
     appropriate selection algorithm must be chosen carefully, as it is
     dependent on application assumptions and understanding of the degree
     of state coordination between the ASP-ACTIVE ASPs in the AS.
