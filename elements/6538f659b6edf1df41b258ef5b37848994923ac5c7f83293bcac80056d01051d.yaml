              Interval timers should be implemented to avoid drift.  In
              some router implementations, packet processing can affect
              timer execution.  When multiple routers are attached to a
              single network, all doing broadcasts, this can lead to the
              synchronization of routing packets (which should be
              avoided).  If timers cannot be implemented to avoid drift,
              small random amounts should be added to/subtracted from the
              interval timer at each firing.
