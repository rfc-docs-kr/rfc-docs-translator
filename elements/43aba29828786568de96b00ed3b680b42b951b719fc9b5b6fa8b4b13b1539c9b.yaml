          The previous section described the operation of the protocol
          within a single area.  For intra-area routing, no other routing
          information is pertinent.  In order to be able to route to
          destinations outside of the area, the area border routers inject
          additional routing information into the area.  This additional
          information is a distillation of the rest of the Autonomous
          System's topology.
