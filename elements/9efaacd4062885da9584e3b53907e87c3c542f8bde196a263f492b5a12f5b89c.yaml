     o  For use in PPP, EAP requires the addition of a new authentication
        Type to PPP LCP and thus PPP implementations will need to be
        modified to use it.  It also strays from the previous PPP
        authentication model of negotiating a specific authentication
        mechanism during LCP.  Similarly, switch or access point
        implementations need to support [IEEE-802.1X] in order to use EAP.
