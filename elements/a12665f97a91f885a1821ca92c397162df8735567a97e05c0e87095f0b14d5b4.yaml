     Rule #2 guarantees that no routing loops form due to aggregation.
     Consider a mid-level network which has been allocated the 2048 class
     C networks starting with 192.24.0.0 (see the example in section 5 for
     more on this).  The mid-level advertises to a "backbone"
     192.24.0.0/255.248.0.0. Assume that the "backbone", in turn, has been
     allocated the block of networks 192.0.0.0/255.0.0.0. The backbone
     will then advertise this aggregate route to the mid-level. Now, if
     the mid-level loses internal connectivity to the network
     192.24.1.0/255.255.255.0 (which is part of its aggregate), traffic
     from the "backbone" to the mid-level to destination 192.24.1.1 will
     follow the mid-level's advertised route. When that traffic gets to
     the mid-level, however, the mid-level *must not* follow the route
     192.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 it learned from the backbone, since that would
     result in a routing loop. Rule #2 says that the mid-level may not
     follow a less-specific route for a destination which matches one of
     its own aggregated routes. Note that handling of the "default" route
     (0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0) is a special case of this rule - a network must not
     follow the default to destinations which are part of one of it's
     aggregated advertisements.
