     Each subtree data fragment is compared by the server to the internal
     data models supported by the server.  If the entire subtree data-
     fragment filter (starting from the root to the innermost element
     specified in the filter) exactly matches a corresponding portion of
     the supported data model, then that node and all its children are
     included in the result data.
