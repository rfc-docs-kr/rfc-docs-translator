              AS-external-LSAs are the only type of LSAs that are flooded
              throughout the entire Autonomous System; all other types of
              LSAs are specific to a single area.  However, AS-external-
              LSAs are not flooded into/throughout stub areas (see Section
              3.6).  This enables a reduction in link state database size
              for routers internal to stub areas.
