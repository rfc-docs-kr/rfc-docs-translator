     (a)  There are two thresholds R1 and R2 measuring the amount of
          retransmission that has occurred for the same segment.  R1 and
          R2 might be measured in time units or as a count of
          retransmissions (with the current RTO and corresponding backoffs
          as a conversion factor, if needed).

  (a) 동일한 세그먼트에 대해 발생한 재전송량을 측정하는 두 개의 임계값 R1과 R2가 있습니다. R1 및 R2는 시간 단위 또는 재전송 횟수로 측정될 수 있습니다(필요한 경우 현재 RTO 및 해당 백오프를 변환 계수로 사용).
