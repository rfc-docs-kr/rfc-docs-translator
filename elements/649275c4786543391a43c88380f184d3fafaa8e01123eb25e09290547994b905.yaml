     To increase the success probability with the techniques described
     below and to aid with transition to IPv6, implementors SHOULD take
     particular care to include both IPv4 and IPv6 candidates as part of
     the process of gathering candidates.  If the local network or host
     does not support IPv6 addressing, then clients SHOULD make use of
     other techniques, e.g., TURN-IPv6 [RFC6156], Teredo [RFC4380], or
     SOCKS IPv4-IPv6 gatewaying [RFC3089], for obtaining IPv6 candidates.
