     "RSAP-IP-Client" may be defined similar to RSA-IP-Client with the
     variation that RSAP-IP-Client assumes a tuple of (external address,
     transport Identifier) when connecting to hosts in external realm to
     pursue end-to-end communication. As such, communication with external
     nodes for an RSAP-IP-Client may be limited to TCP, UDP and ICMP
     sessions.
