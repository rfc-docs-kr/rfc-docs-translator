     A Diameter node that receives a successful authentication and/or
     authorization message from the Diameter server SHOULD collect
     accounting information for the session.  The Accounting-Request
     message is used to transmit the accounting information to the
     Diameter server, which MUST reply with the Accounting-Answer message
     to confirm reception.  The Accounting-Answer message includes the
     Result-Code AVP, which MAY indicate that an error was present in the
     accounting message.  The value of the Accounting-Realtime-Required
     AVP received earlier for the session in question may indicate that
     the user's session has to be terminated when a rejected Accounting-
     Request message was received.
