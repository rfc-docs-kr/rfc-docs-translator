     If the host has an operable routable IPv4 address on one or more
     networks, and if DHCPv4 is enabled on the interface, the host SHOULD
     attempt to acquire an IPv4 configuration using DHCPv4, in parallel
     with one or more reachability tests.  This is accomplished by
     entering the INIT-REBOOT state and sending a DHCPREQUEST to the
     broadcast address, as specified in Section 4.4.2 of the DHCP
     specification [RFC2131].
