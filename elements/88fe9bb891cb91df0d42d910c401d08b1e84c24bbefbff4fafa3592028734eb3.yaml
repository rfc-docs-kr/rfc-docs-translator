      IP interface mask
          Also referred to as the subnet mask, this indicates the portion
          of the IP interface address that identifies the attached
          network.  Masking the IP interface address with the IP interface
          mask yields the IP network number of the attached network.  On
          point-to-point networks and virtual links, the IP interface mask
          is not defined. On these networks, the link itself is not
          assigned an IP network number, and so the addresses of each side
          of the link are assigned independently, if they are assigned at
          all.
