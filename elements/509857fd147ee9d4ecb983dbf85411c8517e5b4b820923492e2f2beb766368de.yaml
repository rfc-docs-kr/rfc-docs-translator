                The tricky part of reassembly is the bookkeeping to
                determine when all bytes of the datagram have been
                reassembled.  We recommend Clark's algorithm [IP:10] that
                requires no additional data space for the bookkeeping.
                However, note that, contrary to [IP:10], the first
                fragment header needs to be saved for inclusion in a
                possible ICMP Time Exceeded (Reassembly Timeout) message.
