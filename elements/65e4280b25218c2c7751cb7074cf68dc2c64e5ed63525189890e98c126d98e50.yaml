              A Destination Unreachable message that is received MUST be
              reported to the transport layer.  The transport layer SHOULD
              use the information appropriately; for example, see Sections
              4.1.3.3, 4.2.3.9, and 4.2.4 below.  A transport protocol
              that has its own mechanism for notifying the sender that a
              port is unreachable (e.g., TCP, which sends RST segments)
              MUST nevertheless accept an ICMP Port Unreachable for the
              same purpose.
