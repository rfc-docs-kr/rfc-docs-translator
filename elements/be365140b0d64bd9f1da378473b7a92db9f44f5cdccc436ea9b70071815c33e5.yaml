     The STOP method from the client to the server tells the resource to
     stop recognition if a request is active.  If a RECOGNIZE request is
     active and the STOP request successfully terminated it, then the
     response header section contains an Active-Request-Id-List header
     field containing the request-id of the RECOGNIZE request that was
     terminated.  In this case, no RECOGNITION-COMPLETE event is sent for
     the terminated request.  If there was no recognition active, then the
     response MUST NOT contain an Active-Request-Id-List header field.
     Either way, the response MUST contain a status-code of 200 "Success".

  클라이언트에서 서버로의 STOP 메서드는 요청이 활성화된 경우 리소스에 인식을 중지하라고 알립니다. RECOGNIZE 요청이 활성화되어 있고 STOP 요청이 성공적으로 종료된 경우 응답 헤더 섹션에는 종료된 RECOGNIZE 요청의 요청 ID가 포함된 Active-Request-Id-List 헤더 필드가 포함됩니다. 이 경우 종료된 요청에 대해 RECOGNITION-COMPLETE 이벤트가 전송되지 않습니다. 활성화된 인식이 없는 경우 응답에는 Active-Request-Id-List 헤더 필드가 포함되어서는 안 됩니다. 어느 쪽이든 응답에는 200 "성공" 상태 코드가 포함되어야 합니다.
