     To arrive at a set of relevant metrics, it would be beneficial to
     look at the metrics used in existing ICN approaches, such as Content-
     Centric Networking (CCN) [Jacobson09] [VoCCN] [Zhang10b], NetInf
     [4WARD6.1] [4WARD6.3] [SAIL-B2] [SAIL-B3], PURSUIT [PRST4.5], COMET
     [CMT-D5.2] [CMT-D6.2], Connect [Muscariello11] [Perino11], and
     CONVERGENCE [Detti12] [Blefari-Melazzi12] [Salsano12].  The metrics
     used in these approaches fall into two categories: metrics for the
     approach as a whole, and metrics for individual components (name
     resolution, routing, and so on).  Metrics for the entire approach are
     further subdivided into traffic and system metrics.  It is important
     to note that the various approaches do not name or define metrics
     consistently.  This is a major problem when trying to find metrics
     that allow comparison between approaches.  For the purposes of
     exposition, we have tried to smooth over differences by classifying
     similarly defined metrics under the same name.  Also, due to space
     constraints, we have chosen to report here only the most common
     metrics between approaches.  For more details, the reader should
     consult the references for each approach.
