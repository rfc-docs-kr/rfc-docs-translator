        [RFC-959] describes the use of Telnet commands (IP and DM) and the
        TCP Urgent pointer to indicate the transmission of commands on the
        control channel during the execution of a data transfer.  FTP uses
        the Telnet Interrupt Process and Data Mark commands in conjunction
        with Urgent data to preface two commands: ABOR (Abort Transfer)
        and STAT (Status request).
