         When a MIB is used for configuration, an object with this SYNTAX
         always contains a legal value (if non-zero) for an index that is
         not currently used in the relevant table. The Command Generator
         (Network Management Application) reads this variable and uses the
         (non-zero) value read when creating a new row with an SNMP SET.
         When the SET is performed, the Command Responder (agent) must
         determine whether the value is indeed still unused; Two Network
         Management Applications may attempt to create a row
         (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If
         it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the Command
         Responder (agent) changes the value of this object, according to
         an implementation-specific algorithm.  If the value is in use,
