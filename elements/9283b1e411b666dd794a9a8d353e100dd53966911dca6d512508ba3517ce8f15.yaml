     Since ICN is an emerging area, the community is in the process of
     developing effective evaluation environments, including releasing
     open-source implementations, simulators, emulators, and testbeds.  To
     date, none of the available evaluation tools can be seen as the one
     and only community reference evaluation tool.  Furthermore, no single
     environment supports all well-known ICN approaches, as we describe
     below, hindering the direct comparison of the results obtained for
     different ICN approaches.  The subsections that follow review the
     currently publicly available ICN implementations, simulators, and
     experimental facilities.
