     ccnSim [ccnSim] is a CCN-specific simulator that was specially
     designed to handle forwarding of a large number of CCN-chunks
     (http://www.infres.enst.fr/~drossi/index.php?n=Software.ccnSim).
     ccnSim is written in C++ for the OMNeT++ simulation framework
     (https://omnetpp.org).  Other CCN-specific simulators include the CCN
     Packet-Level Simulator [CCNPL] and CCN-Joker [Cianci12].  CCN-Joker
     emulates in user space all basic aspects of a CCN node (e.g.,
     handling of Interest and Data packets, cache sizing, replacement
     policies), including both flow and congestion control.  The code is
     open source and is suitable for both emulation-based analyses and
     real experiments.  Finally, Cabral et al. [MiniCCNx] use container-
     based emulation and resource isolation techniques to develop a
     prototyping and emulation tool.
