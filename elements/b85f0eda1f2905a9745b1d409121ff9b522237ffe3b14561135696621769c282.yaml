     Note that some aggregation efficiency gain can still be had for
     multi-homed sites (and, in general, for any site composed of
     multiple, logical IPv4 networks); by allocating a contiguous power-
     of-two block address space to the site (as opposed to multiple,
     independent prefixes), the site's routing information may be
     aggregated into a single prefix.  Also, since the routing cost
     associated with assigning a multi-homed site out of a service
     provider's address space is no greater than the old method of
     sequential number assignment by a central authority, it makes sense
     to assign all end-site address space out of blocks allocated to
     service providers.
