     Version 1.0 of this capability was defined in [RFC4741].  Version 1.1
     is defined in this document, and extends version 1.0 by adding a new
     operation, <cancel-commit>, and two new optional parameters,
     <persist> and <persist-id>.  For backwards compatibility with old
     clients, servers conforming to this specification MAY advertise
     version 1.0 in addition to version 1.1.
