        RADIUS does not support error messages, capability negotiation, or
        a mandatory/non-mandatory flag for attributes.  Since RADIUS
        clients and servers are not aware of each other's capabilities,
        they may not be able to successfully negotiate a mutually
        acceptable service or, in some cases, even be aware of what
        service has been implemented.  Diameter includes support for error
        handling (Section 7), capability negotiation (Section 5.3), and
        mandatory/non-mandatory Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs)
        (Section 4.1).
