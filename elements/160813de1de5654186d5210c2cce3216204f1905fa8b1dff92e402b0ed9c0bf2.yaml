     Out-of-order delivery has special concerns during a connection
     establishment and termination.  When a connection is established, the
     responder side sends a CEA message and moves to R-Open state as
     specified in Section 5.6.  If an application message is sent shortly
     after the CEA and delivered out-of-order, the initiator side, still
     in Wait-I-CEA state, will discard the application message and close
     the connection.  In order to avoid this race condition, the receiver
     side SHOULD NOT use out-of-order delivery methods until the first
     message has been received from the initiator, proving that it has
     moved to I-Open state.  To trigger such a message, the receiver side
     could send a DWR immediately after sending a CEA.  Upon reception of
     the corresponding DWA, the receiver side should start using out-of-
     order delivery methods to counter the HOL blocking.
