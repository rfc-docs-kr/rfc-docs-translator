      o   Routing protocol packets are sent with IP precedence set to
          Internetwork Control.  OSPF protocol packets should be given
          precedence over regular IP data traffic, in both sending and
          receiving.  Setting the IP precedence field in the IP header to
          Internetwork Control [Ref5] may help implement this objective.
