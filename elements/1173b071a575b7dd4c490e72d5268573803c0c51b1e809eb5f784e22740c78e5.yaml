     [c] EAP peer and authenticator layers.  Based on the Code field, the
         EAP layer demultiplexes incoming EAP packets to the EAP peer and
         authenticator layers.  Typically, an EAP implementation on a
         given host will support either peer or authenticator
         functionality, but it is possible for a host to act as both an
         EAP peer and authenticator.  In such an implementation both EAP
         peer and authenticator layers will be present.
