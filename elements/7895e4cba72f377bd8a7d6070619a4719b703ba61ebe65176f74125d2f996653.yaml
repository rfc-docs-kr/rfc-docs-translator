     The "Nagle algorithm" was described in RFC 896 [17] and was
     recommended in RFC 1122 [19] for mitigation of an early problem of
     too many small packets being generated.  It has been implemented in
     most current TCP code bases, sometimes with minor variations (see
     Appendix A.3).

  "Nagle 알고리즘"은 RFC 896 [17]에 설명되어 있으며 너무 많은 작은 패킷이 생성되는 초기 문제를 완화하기 위해 RFC 1122 [19]에서 권장되었습니다. 이는 대부분의 최신 TCP 코드 기반에서 구현되었으며 때로는 약간의 변형이 있었습니다(부록 A.3 참조).
