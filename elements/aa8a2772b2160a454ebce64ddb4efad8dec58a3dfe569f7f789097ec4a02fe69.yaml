        The duration of the lock is defined as beginning when the lock is
        acquired and lasting until either the lock is released or the
        NETCONF session closes.  The session closure can be explicitly
        performed by the client, or implicitly performed by the server
        based on criteria such as failure of the underlying transport,
        simple inactivity timeout, or detection of abusive behavior on the
        part of the client.  These criteria are dependent on the
        implementation and the underlying transport.
