     CoAP operates under a similar request/response model as HTTP: a CoAP
     endpoint in the role of a "client" sends one or more CoAP requests to
     a "server", which services the requests by sending CoAP responses.
     Unlike HTTP, requests and responses are not sent over a previously
     established connection but are exchanged asynchronously over CoAP
     messages.

  CoAP는 HTTP와 유사한 요청/응답 모델에 따라 작동합니다. "클라이언트" 역할의 CoAP 끝점은 하나 이상의 CoAP 요청을 "서버"에 보내고, 서버는 CoAP 응답을 보내 요청을 처리합니다. HTTP와 달리 요청과 응답은 이전에 설정된 연결을 통해 전송되지 않고 CoAP 메시지를 통해 비동기적으로 교환됩니다.
