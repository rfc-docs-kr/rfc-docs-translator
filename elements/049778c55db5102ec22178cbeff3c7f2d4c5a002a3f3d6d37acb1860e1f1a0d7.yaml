     Common ways to implement this include various forms of Weighted Fair
     Queuing (WFQ) or Weighted Round Robin (WRR).  Integrated over a
     longer interval, these give each class a predictable throughput rate.
     They differ in that over short intervals they will order traffic
     differently.  In general, traffic classes that keep traffic in queue
     will tend to absorb latency from queues with lower mean occupancy, in
     exchange for which they make use of any available capacity.
