     For the proposed address allocation scheme, this implies that
     portions of IP address space should be assigned to each TRD
     (explicitly including the backbones and regionals). For those leaf
     routing domains which are connected to a single TRD, they should be
     assigned a prefix value from the address space assigned to that TRD.
