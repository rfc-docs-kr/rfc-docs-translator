     Software that provides email service via the Internet Message Access
     Protocol (IMAP) [RFC3501], the Post Office Protocol (POP) [RFC1939],
     and/or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) Submission [RFC6409]
     usually has Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] support but
     often does not use it in a way that maximizes end-user
     confidentiality.  This specification describes current
     recommendations for the use of TLS in interactions between Mail User
     Agents (MUAs) and Mail Access Servers, and also between MUAs and Mail
     Submission Servers.
