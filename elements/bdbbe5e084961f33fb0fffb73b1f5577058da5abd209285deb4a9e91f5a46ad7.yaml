                  Consider again the area configuration in Figure 6.
                  Routers RT3, RT4, RT7, RT10 and RT11 are all area border
                  routers, and therefore are originating summary-LSAs.
                  Consider in particular Router RT4.  Its routing table
                  was calculated as the example in Section 11.3.  RT4
                  originates summary-LSAs into both the backbone and Area
                  1.  Into the backbone, Router RT4 originates separate
                  LSAs for each of the networks N1-N4.  Into Area 1,
                  Router RT4 originates separate LSAs for networks N6-N8
                  and the AS boundary routers RT5,RT7.  It also condenses
                  host routes Ia and Ib into a single summary-LSA.
                  Finally, the routes to networks N9,N10,N11 and Host H1
                  are advertised by a single summary-LSA.  This
                  condensation was originally performed by the router
                  RT11.
