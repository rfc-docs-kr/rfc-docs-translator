     Because this document specifies that the SRH is only for use within a
     RPL routing domain, such attacks cannot be mounted from outside a RPL
     routing domain.  As specified in this document, RPL routers MUST drop
     datagrams entering or exiting a RPL routing domain that contain an
     SRH in the IPv6 Extension headers.
