     When the answerer receives an SDP with more media descriptions than
     the previous SDP from the offerer, or it receives an SDP with a media
     stream in a slot where the port was previously zero, the answerer
     knows that new media streams are being added.  These can be rejected
     or accepted by placing an appropriately structured media description
     in the answer.  The procedures for constructing the new media
     description in the answer are described in Section 6.

  응답자가 제공자로부터 이전 SDP보다 더 많은 미디어 설명이 있는 SDP를 받거나, 이전에 포트가 0이었던 슬롯에 미디어 스트림이 있는 SDP를 받으면 응답자는 새로운 미디어 스트림이 추가되고 있음을 알게 됩니다. 이는 응답에 적절하게 구성된 미디어 설명을 배치하여 거부하거나 수락할 수 있습니다. 응답에서 새로운 미디어 설명을 구성하는 절차는 섹션 6에 설명되어 있습니다.
