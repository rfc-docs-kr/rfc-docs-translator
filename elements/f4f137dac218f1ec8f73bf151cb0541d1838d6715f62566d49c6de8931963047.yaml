     The Destination-Realm AVP (AVP Code 283) is of type DiameterIdentity
     and contains the realm to which the message is to be routed.  The
     Destination-Realm AVP MUST NOT be present in answer messages.
     Diameter clients insert the realm portion of the User-Name AVP.
     Diameter servers initiating a request message use the value of the
     Origin-Realm AVP from a previous message received from the intended
     target host (unless it is known a priori).  When present, the
     Destination-Realm AVP is used to perform message routing decisions.
