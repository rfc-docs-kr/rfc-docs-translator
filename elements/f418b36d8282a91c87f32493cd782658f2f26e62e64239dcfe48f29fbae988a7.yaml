     The filter in this example contains one selection node (<users>), so
     just that subtree is selected by the filter.  This example represents
     the fully populated <users> data model in most of the filter examples
     that follow.  In a real data model, the <company-info> would not
     likely be returned with the list of users for a particular host or
     network.
