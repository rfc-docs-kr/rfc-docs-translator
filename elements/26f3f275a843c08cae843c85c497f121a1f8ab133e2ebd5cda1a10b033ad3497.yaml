                A basic objective of the Internet design is to tolerate a
                wide range of network characteristics -- e.g., bandwidth,
                delay, packet loss, packet reordering, and maximum packet
                size.  Another objective is robustness against failure of
                individual networks, gateways, and hosts, using whatever
                bandwidth is still available.  Finally, the goal is full
                "open system interconnection": an Internet host must be
                able to interoperate robustly and effectively with any
                other Internet host, across diverse Internet paths.
