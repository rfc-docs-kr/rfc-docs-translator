      The virtual link is treated as if it were an unnumbered point-to-
      point network belonging to the backbone and joining the two area
      border routers.  An attempt is made to establish an adjacency over
      the virtual link.  When this adjacency is established, the virtual
      link will be included in backbone router-LSAs, and OSPF packets
      pertaining to the backbone area will flow over the adjacency.  Such
      an adjacency has been referred to in this document as a "virtual
      adjacency".
