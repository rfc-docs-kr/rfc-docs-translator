              Summary-LSAs are originated by area border routers.  The
              precise summary routes to advertise into an area are
              determined by examining the routing table structure (see
              Section 11) in accordance with the algorithm described
              below. Note that only intra-area routes are advertised into
              the backbone, while both intra-area and inter-area routes
              are advertised into the other areas.
