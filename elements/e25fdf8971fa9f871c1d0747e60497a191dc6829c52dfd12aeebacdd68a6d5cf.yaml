     Note that one provider may choose to perform aggregation on the
     routes it receives from another without explicit agreement; this is
     termed "proxy aggregation".  This can be a useful tool for reducing
     the amount of routing state that an AS must carry and propagate to
     its customers and neighbors.  However, proxy aggregation can also
     create unintended consequences in traffic engineering.  Consider what
     happens if both AS 2 and 3 receive routes from AS 1 but AS 2 performs
     proxy aggregation while AS 3 does not.  Other ASes that receive
     transit routing information from both AS 2 and AS 3 will see an
     inconsistent view of the routing information originated by AS 1.
     This may cause an unexpected shift of traffic toward AS 1 through AS
     3 for AS 3's customers and any others receiving transit routes from
     AS 3.  Because proxy aggregation can cause unanticipated consequences
     for parts of the Internet that have no relationship with either the
     source of the aggregated routes or the party providing aggregation,
     it should be used with extreme caution.
