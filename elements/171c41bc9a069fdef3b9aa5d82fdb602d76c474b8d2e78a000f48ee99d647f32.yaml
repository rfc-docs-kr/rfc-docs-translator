              Implementations can use any set of steps that results in the
              same result as the following set of steps.  Begin by
              removing and saving the ICV field.  Next check the overall
              length of the ESP packet minus the ICV field.  If implicit
              padding is required, based on the block size of the
              integrity algorithm, append zero-filled bytes to the end of
              the ESP packet directly after the Next Header field, or
              after the high-order 32 bits of the sequence number if ESN
              is selected.  Perform the ICV computation and compare the
              result with the saved value, using the comparison rules
              defined by the algorithm specification.
