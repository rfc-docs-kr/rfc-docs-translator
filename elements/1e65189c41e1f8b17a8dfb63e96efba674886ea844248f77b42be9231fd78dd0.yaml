     Also, the Diameter peer MUST check to make sure that the discovered
     peers are authorized to act in its role.  Authentication via IKE or
     TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP, or validation of DNS RRs via DNSSEC is not
     sufficient to conclude this.  For example, a web server may have
     obtained a valid TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP certificate, and secured RRs
     may be included in the DNS, but this does not imply that it is
     authorized to act as a Diameter server.
