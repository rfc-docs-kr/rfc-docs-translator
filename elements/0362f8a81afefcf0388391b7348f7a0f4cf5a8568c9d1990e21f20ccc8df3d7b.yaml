     In this example, "funky-feature" is the feature tag that indicates to
     the client that the fictional Funky-Parameter field is required.  The
     relationship between "funky-feature" and Funky-Parameter is not
     communicated via the RTSP exchange, since that relationship is an
     immutable property of "funky-feature" and thus should not be
     transmitted with every exchange.

  이 예에서 "funky-feature"는 가상의 Funky-Parameter 필드가 필요함을 클라이언트에 나타내는 기능 태그입니다. "funky-feature"와 Funky-Parameter 사이의 관계는 RTSP 교환을 통해 전달되지 않습니다. 왜냐하면 해당 관계는 "funky-feature"의 불변 속성이므로 모든 교환을 통해 전송되어서는 안 되기 때문입니다.
