     It has already been mentioned that some of the process ID's
     registered along with their symbolic names at the information
     operator might be long-term unique numbers gotten from the Unique
     Number Process.  It should also be mentioned that there would seem to
     be no reason, other than scarcity of storage space, that in addition
     to the port number through which primary access is gained to a
     process and which was called the process ID in the previous section,
     arbitrary port numbers along with their symbolic identified could not
     be registered with an information operator.  For instance, rather
     than registering the name BBN-FORTRAN and a single port number, one
     could perhaps register the port numbers whose symbolic identifiers
     were BBN-FORTRAN-CONTROL-TELETYPE, BBN-FORTRAN-INPUT-FILE, BBN-
     FORTRAN-LISTING-FILE, and BBN-FORTRAN-BINARY-OUTPUT-FILE.  This is
     perhaps at odds with standard practice within operating systems, but
     is consistent with the philosophy of reference 4 that communication
     is done with ports and not processes.

  정보 운영자에게 기호명과 함께 등록된 프로세스 ID 중 일부는 고유번호 프로세스에서 얻은 장기 고유번호일 수 있다는 점은 이미 언급한 바 있다. 또한 프로세스에 대한 기본 액세스 권한을 얻는 데 사용되는 포트 번호(이전 섹션에서 프로세스 ID라고 함) 외에 임의의 포트 번호는 저장 공간이 부족한 것 외에는 아무 이유도 없는 것으로 보인다는 점을 언급해야 합니다. 포트 번호와 기호 식별은 정보 운영자에게 등록될 수 없습니다. 예를 들어, BBN-FORTRAN이라는 이름과 단일 포트 번호를 등록하는 대신 기호 식별자가 BBN-FORTRAN-Control-TELETYPE, BBN-FORTRAN-INPUT-FILE, BBN-FORTRAN-LISTING-인 포트 번호를 등록할 수 있습니다. 파일 및 BBN-FORTRAN-BINARY-OUTPUT-FILE. 이는 아마도 운영 체제 내의 표준 관행과 상충될 수 있지만 통신이 프로세스가 아닌 포트를 통해 수행된다는 참조 4의 철학과 일치합니다.
