     There are many instances where a private network (such as a corporate
     network) is spread over different locations and use public backbone
     for communications between those locations. In such cases, it is not
     desirable to do address translation, both because large numbers of
     hosts may want to communicate across the backbone, thus requiring
     large address tables, and because there will be more applications
     that depend on configured addresses, as opposed to going to a name
     server. We call such a private network a backbone-partitioned private
     network.
