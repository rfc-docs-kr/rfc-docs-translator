          The neighborhood of each network node in the graph depends on
          the network's type (point-to-point, broadcast, NBMA or Point-
          to-MultiPoint) and the number of routers having an interface to
          the network.  Three cases are depicted in Figure 1a.  Rectangles
          indicate routers.  Circles and oblongs indicate networks.
          Router names are prefixed with the letters RT and network names
          with the letter N.  Router interface names are prefixed by the
          letter I.  Lines between routers indicate point-to-point
          networks.  The left side of the figure shows networks with their
          connected routers, with the resulting graphs shown on the right.
