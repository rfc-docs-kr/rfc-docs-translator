     A Signalling Gateway is used to support the transport of MTP3-User
     signalling traffic received from the SS7 network to multiple
     distributed ASPs (e.g., MGCs and IP Databases).  Clearly, the M3UA
     protocol is not designed to meet the performance and reliability
     requirements for such transport by itself.  However, the conjunction
     of distributed architecture and redundant networks provides support
     for reliable transport of signalling traffic over IP.  The M3UA
     protocol is flexible enough to allow its operation and management in
     a variety of physical configurations, enabling Network Operators to
     meet their performance and reliability requirements.
