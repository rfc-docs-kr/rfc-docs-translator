     Server operators often deploy (D)TLS termination to act as the server
     for inbound TLS connections.  These termination services can be in
     locations such as remote data centers or Content Delivery Networks
     (CDNs) where it may be difficult to detect compromises of private key
     material corresponding to TLS certificates.  Short-lived certificates
     may be used to limit the exposure of keys in these cases.
