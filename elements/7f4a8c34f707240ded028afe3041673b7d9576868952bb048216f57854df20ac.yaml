     The original article ([Poly1305]) is titled "The Poly1305-AES
     message-authentication code", and the MAC function there requires a
     128-bit AES key, a 128-bit "additional key", and a 128-bit (non-
     secret) nonce.  AES is used there for encrypting the nonce, so as to
     get a unique (and secret) 128-bit string, but as the paper states,
     "There is nothing special about AES here.  One can replace AES with
     an arbitrary keyed function from an arbitrary set of nonces to
     16-byte strings."
