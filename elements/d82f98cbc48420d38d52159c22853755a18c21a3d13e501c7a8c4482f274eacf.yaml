     While the notion of routing data abstraction may be applied to
     various types of routing information, this paper focuses on one
     particular type, namely reachability information. Reachability
     information describes the set of reachable destinations.  Abstraction
     of reachability information dictates that IP addresses be assigned
     according to topological routing structures. However, administrative
     assignment falls along organizational or political boundaries. These
     may not be congruent to topological boundaries and therefore the
     requirements of the two may collide. It is necessary to find a
     balance between these two needs.
