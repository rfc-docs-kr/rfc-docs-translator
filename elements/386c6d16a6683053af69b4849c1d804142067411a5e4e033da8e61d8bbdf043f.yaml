      [12]MaxAgeDiff is an architectural constant.  It indicates the
      maximum dispersion of ages, in seconds, that can occur for a single
      LSA instance as it is flooded throughout the routing domain.  If two
      LSAs differ by more than this, they are assumed to be different
      instances of the same LSA.  This can occur when a router restarts
      and loses track of the LSA's previous LS sequence number.  See
      Section 13.4 for more details.
