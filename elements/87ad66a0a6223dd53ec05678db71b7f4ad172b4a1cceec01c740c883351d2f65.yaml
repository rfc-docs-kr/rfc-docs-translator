     The :xpath capability modifies the <get> and <get-config> operations
     to accept the value "xpath" in the "type" attribute of the <filter>
     element.  When the "type" attribute is set to "xpath", a "select"
     attribute MUST be present on the <filter> element.  The "select"
     attribute will be treated as an XPath expression and used to filter
     the returned data.  The <filter> element itself MUST be empty in this
     case.
