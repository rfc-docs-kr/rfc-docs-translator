          The third change is to step 8 in Section 13. Confusion between
          routers as to which LSA instance is more recent can cause a
          disastrous amount of flooding in a link-state protocol (see
          [Ref26]). OSPF guards against this problem in two ways: a) the
          LS age field is used like a TTL field in flooding, to eventually
          remove looping LSAs from the network (see Section 13.3), and b)
          routers refuse to accept LSA updates more frequently than once
          every MinLSArrival seconds (see Section 13).  However, there is
          still one case in RFC 2178 where disagreements regarding which
          LSA is more recent can cause a lot of flooding traffic:
          responding to old LSAs by reflooding the database copy.  For
          this reason, Step 8 of Section 13 has been amended to only
          respond with the database copy when that copy has not been sent
          in any Link State Update within the last MinLSArrival seconds.
