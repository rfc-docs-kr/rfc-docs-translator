     When a host needs information that one or more of its neighbors might
     have, it could have a list of neighbors to ask, or it could poll all
     of its possible neighbors until one responds.  Use of a wired-in list
     creates obvious network management problems (early binding is
     inflexible).  On the other hand, asking all of one's neighbors is
     slow if one must generate plausible host addresses, and try them
     until one works.  On the ARPANET, for example, there are roughly 65
     thousand plausible host numbers.  Most IP implementations have used
     wired-in lists (for example, addresses of "Prime" gateways.)
     Fortunately, broadcasting provides a fast and simple way for a host
     to reach all of its neighbors.
