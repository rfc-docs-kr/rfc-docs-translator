        Within a particular Routing Context, Override, Loadshare, and
        Broadcast SHOULD NOT be mixed.  The Override value indicates that
        the ASP is operating in Override mode, in which the ASP takes over
        all traffic in an Application Server (i.e., primary/backup
        operation), overriding any currently active ASPs in the AS.  In
        Loadshare mode, the ASP will share in the traffic distribution
        with any other currently active ASPs.  In Broadcast mode, the ASP
        will receive the same messages as any other currently active ASP.
