     This document has benefited from extensive discussion and review by
     many of the members of the APPSAWG working group.  The authors would
     like to especially acknowledge the invaluable input of Eran Hammer-
     Lahav, Blaine Cook, Brad Fitzpatrick, Laurent-Walter Goix, Joe
     Clarke, Peter Saint-Andre, Dick Hardt, Tim Bray, James Snell, Melvin
     Carvalho, Evan Prodromou, Mark Nottingham, Elf Pavlik, Bjoern
     Hoehrmann, Subramanian Moonesamy, Joe Gregorio, John Bradley, and
     others that we have undoubtedly, but inadvertently, missed.
