     Note that the "submissions" port provides access to a Message
     Submission Agent (MSA) as defined in [RFC6409], so requirements and
     recommendations for MSAs in that document, including the requirement
     to implement SMTP AUTH [RFC4954] and the requirements of Email
     Submission Operations [RFC5068], also apply to the submissions port.
