        The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) described in [12] can, if
        incorrectly implemented, cause problems when broadcasts are used
        on a network where not all hosts share an understanding of what a
        broadcast address is.  The temptation exists to modify the ARP
        server so that it provides the mapping between an IP broadcast
        address and the hardware broadcast address.
