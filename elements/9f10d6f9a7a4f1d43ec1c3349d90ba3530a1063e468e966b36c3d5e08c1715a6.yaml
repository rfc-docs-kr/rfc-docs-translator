     Note that end-to-end email encryption prevents AVAS software and
     services from using email content as part of a spam or virus
     assessment.  Furthermore, although a minimum confidentiality level
     can prevent a man-in-the-middle from introducing spam or virus
     content between the MUA and Submission server, it does not prevent
     other forms of client or account compromise.  The use of AVAS
     services for submitted email therefore remains necessary.
