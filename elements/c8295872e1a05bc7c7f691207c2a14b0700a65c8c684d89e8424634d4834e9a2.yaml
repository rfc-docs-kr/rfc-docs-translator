              Static configuration information may be necessary in order
              for the Hello Protocol to function on non-broadcast networks
              (see Sections C.5 and C.6).  On NBMA networks, every
              attached router which is eligible to become Designated
              Router becomes aware of all of its neighbors on the network
              (either through configuration or by some unspecified
              mechanism).  Each neighbor is labelled with the neighbor's
              Designated Router eligibility.
