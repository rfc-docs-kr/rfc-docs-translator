     Typically, an address is manually assigned on a network because a
     dynamically assigned address was not suitable for some reason.
     Therefore, where DNAv4 and DHCP are run in parallel and DNAv4
     confirms a manual configuration, it may be undesirable to allow this
     configuration to be overridden by DHCP, as described in Section 2.1.
     However, packet loss may cause the reachability test to fail while
     DHCP completes successfully, resulting in the host obtaining a
     dynamic address where a static address is desired.  In order to
     provide for reliable reconfirmation of manually assigned addresses,
     reachability tests for manual configurations require a more
     aggressive retransmission strategy than that detailed in Section 4.1
     of the DHCP specification [RFC2131].  For example, shorter
     retransmission intervals and more persistent retransmissions may be
     required.
