     If the answerer receives the new offer matching the candidate pair
     where a connection was already created in parallel with the new
     offer, it MUST accept the offer and respond to it while keeping the
     already-created connection.  If the connection that was created in
     parallel with the new offer does not match the candidate pair in the
     new offer, the connection MUST be closed, and ICE restart SHOULD be
     performed.
