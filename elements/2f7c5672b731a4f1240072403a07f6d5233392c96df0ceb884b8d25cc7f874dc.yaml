     There are other cases where the AS/ASP configuration data is created
     dynamically.  In those cases there would be differences in the state
     machine, especially at creation of the AS.  For example, where the
     AS/ASP configuration data is not created until Registration of the
     first ASP, the AS-INACTIVE state is entered directly upon the nth
     successful REG REQ from an ASP belonging to that AS.  Another example
     is where the AS/ASP configuration data is not created until the nth
     ASP successfully enters the ASP-ACTIVE state.  In this latter case,
     the AS-ACTIVE state is entered directly.
