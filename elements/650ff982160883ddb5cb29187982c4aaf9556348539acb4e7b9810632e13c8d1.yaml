     Every Diameter application specification MUST have an IANA-assigned
     Application Id (see Section 2.4).  The managed Application ID space
     is flat, and there is no relationship between different Diameter
     applications with respect to their Application Ids.  As such, there
     is no versioning support provided by these Application Ids
     themselves; every Diameter application is a standalone application.
     If the application has a relationship with other Diameter
     applications, such a relationship is not known to Diameter.
