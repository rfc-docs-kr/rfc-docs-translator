     Configuration of the routes to be combined into aggregates is an
     implementation of routing policy and requires some manually
     maintained information.  As an addition to the information that must
     be maintained for a set of routeable prefixes, aggregation
     configuration is typically just a line or two defining the range of
     the block of IPv4 addresses to be aggregated.  A site performing its
     own aggregation is doing so for address blocks that it has been
     assigned; a site performing aggregation on behalf of another knows
     this information because of an agreement to delegate aggregation.
     Assuming that the best common practice for network administrators is
     to exchange lists of prefixes to accept from each other,
     configuration of aggregation information does not introduce
     significant additional administrative overhead.
