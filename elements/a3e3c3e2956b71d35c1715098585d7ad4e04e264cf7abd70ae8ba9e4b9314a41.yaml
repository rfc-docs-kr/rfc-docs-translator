     When establishing a new configuration for connecting to an IMAP, POP,
     or SMTP submission server, based on SRV records, an MUA SHOULD verify
     that either (a) the SRV records are signed using DNSSEC or (b) the
     target Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the SRV record matches
     the original server FQDN for which the SRV queries were made.  If the
     target FQDN is not in the queried domain, the MUA SHOULD verify with
     the user that the SRV target FQDN is suitable for use, before
     executing any connections to the host.  (See Section 6 of [RFC6186].)
