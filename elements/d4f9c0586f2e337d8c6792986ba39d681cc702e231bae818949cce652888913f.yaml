     TLS permits the resumption of an earlier TLS session or the use of
     another active session when a new session is requested, in order to
     save the expense of another full TLS handshake.  The security
     parameters of the resumed session are reused for the requested
     session.  The security parameters SHOULD be checked against the
     security requirements of the requested session to make sure that the
     resumed session provides proper security.
