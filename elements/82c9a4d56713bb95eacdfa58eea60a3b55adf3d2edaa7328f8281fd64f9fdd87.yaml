     Such attacks, however, can be mounted from within a RPL routing
     domain.  To mitigate bandwidth exhaustion attacks, this specification
     requires RPL routers to check for loops in the SRH and drop datagrams
     that contain such loops.  Attacks that include bypassing filtering
     devices and reaching otherwise unreachable Internet systems are not
     as relevant in mesh networks since the topologies are, by their very
     nature, highly dynamic.  The RPL routing protocol is designed to
     provide reachability to all devices within a RPL routing domain and
     may utilize routes that traverse any number of devices in any order.
