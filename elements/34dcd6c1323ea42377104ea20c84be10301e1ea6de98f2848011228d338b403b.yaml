          (5) Look up the routing table entry for the destination N.  If
              no entry exists for N, install the AS external path to N,
              with next hop equal to the list of next hops to the
              forwarding address, and advertising router equal to ASBR.
              If the external metric type is 1, then the path-type is set
              to type 1 external and the cost is equal to X+Y.  If the
              external metric type is 2, the path-type is set to type 2
              external, the link state component of the route's cost is X,
              and the type 2 cost is Y.
