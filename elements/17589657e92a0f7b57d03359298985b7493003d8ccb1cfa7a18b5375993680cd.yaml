     The Disconnect-Peer-Request message is used by a Diameter node to
     inform its peer of its intent to disconnect the transport layer and
     that the peer shouldn't reconnect unless it has a valid reason to do
     so (e.g., message to be forwarded).  Upon receipt of the message, the
     Disconnect-Peer-Answer message is returned, which SHOULD contain an
     error if messages have recently been forwarded, and are likely in
     flight, which would otherwise cause a race condition.
