        Within this specification, attributes can be used for
        identification, authorization, or other purposes.  RADIUS
        Attribute specifications created after publication of this
        document SHOULD state whether an attribute can be included in CoA
        or Disconnect messages, and if so, which messages it can be
        included in and whether it serves as an identification or
        authorization attribute.
