     The original EAP method Type space has a range from 1 to 255, and is
     the scarcest resource in EAP, and thus must be allocated with care.
     Method Types 1-45 have been allocated, with 20 available for re-use.
     Method Types 20 and 46-191 may be allocated on the advice of a
     Designated Expert, with Specification Required.
