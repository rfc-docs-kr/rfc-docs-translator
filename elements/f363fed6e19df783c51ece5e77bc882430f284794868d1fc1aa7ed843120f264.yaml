     When TLS is used with most non-Diffie-Hellman cipher suites, it is
     sufficient to obtain the server's private key in order to decrypt any
     sessions (past and future) that were initiated with that server.
     This technique is used, for example, by the popular Wireshark network
     sniffer to inspect TLS-protected connections.
