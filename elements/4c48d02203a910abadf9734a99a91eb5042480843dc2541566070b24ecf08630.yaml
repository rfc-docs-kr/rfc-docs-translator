     The IP address prefix <198.0.0.0 254.0.0.0> provides for
     administrative decentralization. This prefix identifies part of the
     IP address space allocated for North America. The lower order part of
     that prefix allows allocation of IP addresses along topological
     boundaries in support of increased data abstraction.  Clients within
     North America use parts of the IP address space that is underneath
     the IP address space of their service providers.  Within a routing
     domain addresses for subnetworks and hosts are allocated from the
     unique IP prefix assigned to the domain.
