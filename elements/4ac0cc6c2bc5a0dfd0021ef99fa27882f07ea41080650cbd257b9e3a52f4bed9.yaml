     The STARTTLS extension is not suitable for authenticating the author
     of an email message unless every hop in the delivery chain, including
     the submission to the first SMTP server, is authenticated.  Another
     proposal [SMTP-AUTH] can be used to authenticate delivery and MIME
     security multiparts [MIME-SEC] can be used to authenticate the author
     of an email message.  In addition, the [SMTP-AUTH] proposal offers
     simpler and more flexible options to authenticate an SMTP client and
     the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism [SASL] MAY be used in conjunction with
     the STARTTLS command to provide an authorization identity.
