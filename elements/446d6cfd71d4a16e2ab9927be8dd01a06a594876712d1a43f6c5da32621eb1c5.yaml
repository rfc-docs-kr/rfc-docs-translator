     The use of broadcasts, especially on high-speed local area networks,
     is a good base for many applications.  Since broadcasting is not
     covered in the basic IP specification [13], there is no agreed-upon
     way to do it, and so protocol designers have not made use of it. (The
     issue has been touched upon before, e.g. [6], but has not been the
     subject of a standard.)
