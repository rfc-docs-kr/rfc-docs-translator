              The sequence number -N (0x80000000) is reserved (and
              unused).  This leaves -N + 1 (0x80000001) as the smallest
              (and therefore oldest) sequence number; this sequence number
              is referred to as the constant InitialSequenceNumber. A
              router uses InitialSequenceNumber the first time it
              originates any LSA.  Afterwards, the LSA's sequence number
              is incremented each time the router originates a new
              instance of the LSA.  When an attempt is made to increment
              the sequence number past the maximum value of N - 1
              (0x7fffffff; also referred to as MaxSequenceNumber), the
              current instance of the LSA must first be flushed from the
              routing domain.  This is done by prematurely aging the LSA
              (see Section 14.1) and reflooding it.  As soon as this flood
              has been acknowledged by all adjacent neighbors, a new
              instance can be originated with sequence number of
              InitialSequenceNumber.
