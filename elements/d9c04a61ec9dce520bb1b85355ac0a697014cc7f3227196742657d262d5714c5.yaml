        The End-to-End Identifier is an unsigned 32-bit integer field (in
        network byte order) that is used to detect duplicate messages.
        Upon reboot, implementations MAY set the high order 12 bits to
        contain the low order 12 bits of current time, and the low order
        20 bits to a random value.  Senders of request messages MUST
        insert a unique identifier on each message.  The identifier MUST
        remain locally unique for a period of at least 4 minutes, even
        across reboots.  The originator of an answer message MUST ensure
        that the End-to-End Identifier field contains the same value that
        was found in the corresponding request.  The End-to-End Identifier
        MUST NOT be modified by Diameter agents of any kind.  The
        combination of the Origin-Host AVP (Section 6.3) and this field is
        used to detect duplicates.  Duplicate requests SHOULD cause the
        same answer to be transmitted (modulo the Hop-by-Hop Identifier
