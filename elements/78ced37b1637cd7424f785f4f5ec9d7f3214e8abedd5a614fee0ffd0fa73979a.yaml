     The Data field is zero or more octets and contains information
     specific to the Attribute.  The format and length of the Data field
     is determined by the AVP Code and AVP Length fields.  The format of
     the Data field MUST be one of the following base data types or a data
     type derived from the base data types.  In the event that a new Basic
     AVP Data Format is needed, a new version of this RFC MUST be created.
