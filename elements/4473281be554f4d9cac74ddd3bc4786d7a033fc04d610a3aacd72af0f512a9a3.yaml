     2.  IPSP Double Exchange (DE) model.  A double exchange of ASPTM and
        ASPSM messages is normally needed (ASPSM single exchange is
        optional as a simplification).  Each exchange of ASPTM or ASPSM
        messages can be initiated by either IPSP.  The RKs define the
        traffic to be directed to the peer as in the AS-SG model.
        Therefore, two different RKs are usually used, one installed on
        each peer.
