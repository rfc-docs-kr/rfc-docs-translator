     In general, an Add command is used to add Terminations to Contexts.
     If the MGC does not specify an existing Context to which the
     Termination is to be added, the MG creates a new Context.  A
     Termination may be removed from a Context with a Subtract command,
     and a Termination may be moved from one Context to another with a
     Move command. A Termination SHALL exist in only one Context at a
     time.
