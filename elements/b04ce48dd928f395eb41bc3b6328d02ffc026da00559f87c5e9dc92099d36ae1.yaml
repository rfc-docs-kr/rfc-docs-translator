      Link State Update packets are multicast on those physical networks
      that support multicast/broadcast.  In order to make the flooding
      procedure reliable, flooded LSAs are acknowledged in Link State
      Acknowledgment packets.  If retransmission of certain LSAs is
      necessary, the retransmitted LSAs are always sent directly to the
      neighbor.  For more information on the reliable flooding of LSAs,
      consult Section 13.
