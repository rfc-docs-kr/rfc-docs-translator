           However, strict layering is an imperfect model, both for the
           protocol suite and for recommended implementation approaches.
           Protocols in different layers interact in complex and sometimes
           subtle ways, and particular functions often involve multiple
           layers.  There are many design choices in an implementation,
           many of which involve creative "breaking" of strict layering.
           Every implementor is urged to read references [INTRO:7] and
           [INTRO:8].
