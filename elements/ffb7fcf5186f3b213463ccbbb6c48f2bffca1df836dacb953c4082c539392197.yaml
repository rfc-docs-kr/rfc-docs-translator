          (3) An attached network's Designated Router changes.  A new
              router-LSA should be originated.  Also, if the router itself
              is now the Designated Router, a new network-LSA should be
              produced.  If the router itself is no longer the Designated
              Router, any network-LSA that it might have originated for
              the network should be flushed from the routing domain (see
              Section 14.1).
