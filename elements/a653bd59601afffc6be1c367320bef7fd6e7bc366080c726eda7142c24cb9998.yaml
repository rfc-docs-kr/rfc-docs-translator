     NetInf uses the Named Information (ni) URI scheme [RFC6920] to
     identify content.  This allows NetInf to assure validity without any
     additional information but gives no assurance on provenance or
     relevance.  A "search" request allows an application to identify
     relevant content, and applications may choose to structure content to
     allow provenance assurance, but this will typically require
     additional network access.  NetInf validity authentication is
     consequently efficient in a network environment with intermittent
     connectivity as it does not force additional network accesses and
     allows the application to decide on provenance validation if
     required.  For dynamic content, NetInf can use, e.g., signed
     manifests.  For more details on NetInf security, see [Dannewitz10].
