     The TLS protocol is a development of the Netscape Communication
     Corporation's SSL protocol and this document can be used to allow the
     FTP protocol to be used with either SSL or TLS.  The actual protocol
     used will be decided by the negotiation of the protected session by
     the TLS/SSL layer.  This document will only refer to the TLS
     protocol; however, it is understood that the Client and Server MAY
     actually be using SSL if they are so configured.
