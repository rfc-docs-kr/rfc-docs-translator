          Virtual links can be configured between any two backbone routers
          that have an interface to a common non-backbone area.  Virtual
          links belong to the backbone.  The protocol treats two routers
          joined by a virtual link as if they were connected by an
          unnumbered point-to-point backbone network.  On the graph of the
          backbone, two such routers are joined by arcs whose costs are
          the intra-area distances between the two routers.  The routing
          protocol traffic that flows along the virtual link uses intra-
          area routing only.
