        -  "Prevention": Impeding or thwarting a potential security
           violation by deploying a countermeasure.
        -  "Detection": Determining that a security violation is
           impending, is in progress, or has recently occurred, and thus
           make it possible to reduce the potential loss. (See: intrusion
           detection.)
        -  "Recovery": Restoring a normal state of system operation by
           compensating for a security violation, possibly by eliminating
           or repairing its effects. (See: contingency plan, main entry
           for "recovery".)
        -  "Correction": Changing a security architecture to eliminate or
           reduce the risk of reoccurrence of a security violation or
           threat consequence, such as by eliminating a vulnerability.

  - "예방": 대응책을 배포하여 잠재적인 보안 위반을 방해하거나 저지합니다.
  - "탐지": 보안 위반이 임박했거나, 진행 중이거나, 최근에 발생했음을 판단하여 잠재적인 손실을 줄일 수 있게 합니다. (참조: 침입 탐지.)
  - "복구": 보안 위반을 보상하거나 그 영향을 제거하거나 복구하여 시스템 작동의 정상적인 상태를 복원합니다. (참조: 비상 계획, "복구"에 대한 주요 항목.)
  - "수정": 취약점을 제거하는 등 보안 위반 또는 위협 결과의 재발 위험을 제거하거나 줄이기 위해 보안 아키텍처를 변경합니다.
