     example of "easy access" would be to display a dialog informing the
     user that the security requirements of the account were not met by
     the connection but allowing the user to "click through" to send mail
     or access the service anyway.  Experience indicates that users
     presented with such an option often "click through" without
     understanding the risks that they're accepting by doing so.
     Furthermore, users who frequently find the need to "click through" to
     use an insecure connection may become conditioned to do so as a
     matter of habit, before considering whether the risks are reasonable
     in each specific instance.
