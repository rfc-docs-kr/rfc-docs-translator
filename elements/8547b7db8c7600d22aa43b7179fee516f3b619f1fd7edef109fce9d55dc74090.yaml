        Derivation: This single-packet attack was named for "land", the
        program originally published by the cracker who invented this
        exploit. Perhaps that name was chosen because the inventor thought
        of multi-packet (i.e., flooding) attacks as arriving by sea.

  - 파생: 이 단일 패킷 공격은 이 공격을 발명한 크래커가 원래 게시한 프로그램인 "land"의 이름을 따서 명명되었습니다. 아마도 그 이름은 발명가가 다중 패킷(즉, 홍수) 공격이 바다를 통해 도착한다고 생각했기 때문에 선택되었을 것입니다.
