     *  Source spoofing is only effective if the attacker can obtain valid
        pairs of source destination addresses and ports, for example by
        listening to a fraction of the traffic. To fight source spoofing,
        one could try to control all access points to the network.  But
        this is in practice very hard to achieve.
