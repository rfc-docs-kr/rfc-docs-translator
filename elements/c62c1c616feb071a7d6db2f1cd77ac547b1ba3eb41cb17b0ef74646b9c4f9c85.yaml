     A RADIUS server receiving a CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request packet
     from the DAC MAY then add or update attributes (such as adding NAS or
     session identification attributes or appending a State Attribute),
     prior to forwarding the packet.  Having CoA/Disconnect-Requests
     forwarded by a RADIUS server can also enable upstream RADIUS proxies
     to perform a Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) check (see Section 6.1).
