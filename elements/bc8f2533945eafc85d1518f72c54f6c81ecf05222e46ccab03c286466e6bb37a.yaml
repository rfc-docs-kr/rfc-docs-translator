          Backup
              In this state, the router itself is the Backup Designated
              Router on the attached network.  It will be promoted to
              Designated Router when the present Designated Router fails.
              The router establishes adjacencies to all other routers
              attached to the network.  The Backup Designated Router
              performs slightly different functions during the Flooding
              Procedure, as compared to the Designated Router (see Section
              13.3).  See Section 7.4 for more details on the functions
              performed by the Backup Designated Router.
