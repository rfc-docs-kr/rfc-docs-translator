     A NAS implementing this specification SHOULD send an Acct-Session-Id
     or Acct-Multi-Session-Id Attribute within an Access-Request.  Where
     an Acct-Session-Id or Acct-Multi-Session-Id Attribute is not included
     within an Access-Request, the Dynamic Authorization Client will not
     know the Acct-Session-Id or Acct-Multi-Session-Id of the session it
     is attempting to target, unless it also has access to the accounting
     data for that session.
