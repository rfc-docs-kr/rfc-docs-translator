          In states Loading and Full the slave must resend its last
          Database Description packet in response to duplicate Database
          Description packets received from the master.  For this reason
          the slave must wait RouterDeadInterval seconds before freeing
          the last Database Description packet.  Reception of a Database
          Description packet from the master after this interval will
          generate a SeqNumberMismatch neighbor event.
