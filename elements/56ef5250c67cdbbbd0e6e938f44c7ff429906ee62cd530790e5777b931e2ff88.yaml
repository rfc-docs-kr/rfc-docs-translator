     It was noted in [XPROT] that certificates in use by servers that
     support outdated protocols such as SSLv2 can be used to forge
     signatures for certificates that contain the keyEncipherment KeyUsage
     ([RFC5280], Section 4.2.1.3).  In order to reduce the risk of cross-
     protocol attacks on certificates that are not intended to be used
     with DC-capable TLS stacks, we define a new DelegationUsage extension
     to X.509 that permits use of delegated credentials.  (See
     Section 4.2.)
