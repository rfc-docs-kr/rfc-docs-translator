                Every datagram that is broadcast on the connected network
                should have a valid IP broadcast address as its IP
                destination (see Section 3.3.6).  However, some hosts
                violate this rule.  To be certain to detect broadcast
                datagrams, therefore, hosts are required to check for a
                link-layer broadcast as well as an IP-layer broadcast
                address.
