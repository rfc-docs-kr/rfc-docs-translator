     Another area where the architectures have not been significantly
     analyzed is privacy.  Caching implies a trade-off between network
     efficiency and privacy.  The activity of users is significantly more
     exposed to the scrutiny of cache owners with whom they may not have
     any relationship.  However, it should be noted that it is only the
     first-hop router/cache that can see who requests what, as requests
     are aggregated and only the previous-hop router is visible when a
     request is forwarded.
