        An additional factor that discourages allocation of IP addresses
        from a backbone prefix is that the backbones and their attached
        providers are perceived as being independent. Providers may take
        their long- haul service from one or more backbones, or may switch
        backbones should a more cost-effective service be provided
        elsewhere. Having IP addresses derived from a backbone is
        inconsistent with the nature of the relationship.
