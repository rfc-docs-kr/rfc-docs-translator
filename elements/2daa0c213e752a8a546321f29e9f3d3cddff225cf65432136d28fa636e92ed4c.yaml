     At some point, it is expected that this plan will eventually consume
     all of the remaining class C address space.  As of this writing, the
     upper half of the class A address space has already been reserved for
     future expansion.  This section describes how the CIDR plan can be
     used to utilize this portion of the class A space efficiently.  It is
     expected that this contingency would only be used if no long term
     solution has become apparent by the time that the class C address
     space is consumed.
