      With the introduction of areas, it is no longer true that all
      routers in the AS have an identical link-state database.  A router
      actually has a separate link-state database for each area it is
      connected to.  (Routers connected to multiple areas are called area
      border routers).  Two routers belonging to the same area have, for
      that area, identical area link-state databases.
