     The AUTH command takes a single parameter to define the security
     mechanism to be negotiated.  As the SSL/TLS protocols self-negotiate
     their levels, there is no need to distinguish between SSL and TLS in
     the application layer.  The mechanism name for negotiating TLS is the
     character string identified in {TLS-PARM}.  This allows the client
     and server to negotiate TLS on the control connection without
     altering the protection of the data channel.  To protect the data
     channel as well, the PBSZ command, followed by the PROT command
     sequence, MUST be used.
