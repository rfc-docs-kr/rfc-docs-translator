     A potentially major concern for all ICN architectures considered here
     is that they do not provide any inbuilt support for an authorization
     framework or for logging.  Once content has been published and cached
     in servers, routers, or endpoints not controlled by the publisher,
     the publisher has no way to enforce access control, determine which
     users have accessed the content, or revoke its publication.  In fact,
     in some cases (where requests do not necessarily contain host/user
     identifier information), it is difficult for the publishers
     themselves to perform access control.
