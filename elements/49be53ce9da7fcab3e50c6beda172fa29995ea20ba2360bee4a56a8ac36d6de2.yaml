     Where the host does not have an operable routable IPv4 address on any
     network, the host MAY configure an IPv4 Link-Local address prior to
     entering the INIT state and sending a DHCPDISCOVER packet, as
     described in Section 2.3 of the DHCP specification [RFC2131].  Where
     a host can confirm that it remains connected to a network on which it
     possesses an operable routable IPv4 address, that address should be
     used, and the IPv4 Link-Local address is deprecated, as noted in
     Section 1.9 of the IPv4 Link-Local specification [RFC3927].
