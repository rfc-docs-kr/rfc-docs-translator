                   This technique depends upon the host passively
                   receiving ("wiretapping") the Interior Gateway Protocol
                   (IGP) datagrams that the gateways are broadcasting to
                   each other.  This approach has the drawback that a host
                   needs to recognize all the interior gateway protocols
                   that gateways may use (see [INTRO:2]).  In addition, it
                   only works on a broadcast network.
