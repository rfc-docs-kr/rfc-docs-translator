     Twice NAT is typically used when address space used in a Private
     network overlaps with addresses used in the Public space.  For
     example, say a private site uses the 200.200.200.0/24 address space
     which is officially assigned to another site in the public internet.
     Host_A (200.200.200.1) in Private space seeks to connect to Host_X
     (200.200.200.100) in Public space. In order to make this connection
     work, Host_X's address is mapped to a different address for Host_A
     and vice versa. The twice NAT located at the Private site border may
     be configured as follows:
