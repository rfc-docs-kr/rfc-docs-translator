     This document is heavily based on a note written by Ran Atkinson in
     1997.  That note was written after the IAB Security Workshop held in
     early 1997, based on input from everyone at that workshop.  Some of
     the specific text above was taken from Ran's original document, and
     some of that text was taken from an email message written by Fred
     Baker.  The other primary source for this document is specific
     comments received from Steve Bellovin.  Early review of this document
     was done by Lisa Dusseault and Mark Schertler.  Other useful comments
     were received from Bill Fenner, Ned Freed, Lawrence Greenfield, Steve
     Kent, Allison Mankin and Kurt Zeilenga.
