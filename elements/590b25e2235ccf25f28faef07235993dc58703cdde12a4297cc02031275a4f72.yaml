     As noted in [RFC3766], correcting for the emergence of a TWIRL
     machine would imply that 1024-bit DH keys yield about 65 bits of
     equivalent strength and that a 2048-bit DH key would yield about 92
     bits of equivalent strength.

  [RFC3766]에 언급된 대로 TWIRL 머신의 출현을 수정한다는 것은 1024비트 DH 키가 약 65비트의 등가 강도를 생성하고 2048비트 DH 키가 약 92비트의 등가 강도를 생성한다는 것을 의미합니다.
