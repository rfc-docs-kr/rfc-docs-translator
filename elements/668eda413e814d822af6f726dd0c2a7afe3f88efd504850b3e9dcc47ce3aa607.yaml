          The Designated Router is elected by the Hello Protocol.  A
          router's Hello Packet contains its Router Priority, which is
          configurable on a per-interface basis.  In general, when a
          router's interface to a network first becomes functional, it
          checks to see whether there is currently a Designated Router for
          the network.  If there is, it accepts that Designated Router,
          regardless of its Router Priority.  (This makes it harder to
          predict the identity of the Designated Router, but ensures that
          the Designated Router changes less often.  See below.)
          Otherwise, the router itself becomes Designated Router if it has
          the highest Router Priority on the network.  A more detailed
          (and more accurate) description of Designated Router election is
          presented in Section 9.4.
