          (5) As a result of these calculations, the router itself may now
              be Designated Router or Backup Designated Router.  See
              Sections 7.3 and 7.4 for the additional duties this would
              entail.  The router's interface state should be set
              accordingly.  If the router itself is now Designated Router,
              the new interface state is DR.  If the router itself is now
              Backup Designated Router, the new interface state is Backup.
              Otherwise, the new interface state is DR Other.
