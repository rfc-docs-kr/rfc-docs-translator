           The User Datagram Protocol UDP [UDP:1] offers only a minimal
           transport service -- non-guaranteed datagram delivery -- and
           gives applications direct access to the datagram service of the
           IP layer.  UDP is used by applications that do not require the
           level of service of TCP or that wish to use communications
           services (e.g., multicast or broadcast delivery) not available
           from TCP.
