     The MG is provisioned with a name or address (such as DNS name or IP
     address) of a primary and zero or more secondary MGCs (see section
     7.2.8) that is the address the MG uses to send messages to the MGC.
     If TCP or UDP is used as the protocol transport and the port to which
     the initial ServiceChange request is to be sent is not otherwise
     known, that request should be sent to the default port number for the
     protocol.  This port number is 2944 for text-encoded operation or
     2945 for binary-encoded operation, for either UDP or TCP.  The MGC
     receives the message containing the ServiceChange request from the MG
     and can determine the MG's address from it.  As described in section
     7.2.8, either the MG or the MGC may supply an address in the
     ServiceChangeAddress parameter to which subsequent transaction
     requests must be addressed, but responses (including the response to
     the initial ServiceChange request) must always be sent back to the
     address which was the source of the corresponding request.
