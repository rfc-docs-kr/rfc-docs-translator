     Different ICN approaches are evaluated in the peer-reviewed
     literature using a mixture of theoretical analysis, simulation and
     emulation techniques, and empirical (testbed) measurements.  The
     specific methodology employed may depend on the experimentation goal,
     e.g., whether one wants to evaluate scalability, quantify resource
     utilization, or analyze economic incentives.  In addition, though, we
     observe that ease and convenience of setting up and running
     experiments can sometimes be a factor in published evaluations.  As
     discussed in [RFC7476], the development phase that ICN is going
     through and the plethora of approaches to tackle the hardest problems
     make this a very active and growing research area but, on the
     downside, it also makes it more difficult to compare different
     proposals on an equal footing.
