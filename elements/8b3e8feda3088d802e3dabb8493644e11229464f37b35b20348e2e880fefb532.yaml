     Identifier value before acting on them in any way, including passing
     them on to the backend authentication server for verification.  Since
     the authenticator can retransmit before receiving a Response from the

     matching Identifier.  Until a new Request is received by the
     authenticator, the Identifier value is not updated, so that the
     authenticator forwards Responses to the backend authentication
     server, one at a time.
