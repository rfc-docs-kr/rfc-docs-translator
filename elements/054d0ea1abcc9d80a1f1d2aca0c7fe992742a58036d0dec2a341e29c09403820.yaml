     The RowPointer Textual Convention is therefore used in two ways in
     this MIB.  It is defined for the purpose of connecting an object to
     an entry dynamically; the RowPointer object identifies the first
     object in the target Entry, and in so doing points to the entire
     entry.  In this MIB, it is used as a connector between successive
     functional data path elements, and as the link between the policy
     structure and the parameters that are used.  When used as a
     connector, it says what happens "next"; what happens to classified
     traffic, to traffic conforming or not conforming to a meter, and so
     on.  When used to indicate the parameters applied in a policy, it
     says "specifically" what is meant; the structure points to the
     parameters of its policy.
