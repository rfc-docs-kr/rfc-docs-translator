     The global Internet can be modeled as a collection of hosts
     interconnected via transmission and switching facilities.  Control
     over the collection of hosts and the transmission and switching
     facilities that compose the networking resources of the global
     Internet is not homogeneous, but is distributed among multiple
     administrative authorities. Resources under control of a single
     administration form a domain.  For the rest of this paper, "domain"
     and "routing domain" will be used interchangeably.  Domains that
     share their resources with other domains are called network service
     providers (or just providers). Domains that utilize other domain's
     resources are called network service subscribers (or just
     subscribers).  A given domain may act as a provider and a subscriber
     simultaneously.
