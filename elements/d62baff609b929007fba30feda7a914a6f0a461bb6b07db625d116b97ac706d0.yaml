     The server transaction is responsible for the delivery of requests to
     the TU and the reliable transmission of responses.  It accomplishes
     this through a state machine.  Server transactions are created by the
     core when a request is received, and transaction handling is desired
     for that request (this is not always the case).

  서버 트랜잭션은 TU에 대한 요청 전달과 안정적인 응답 전송을 담당합니다. 이는 상태 머신을 통해 수행됩니다. 서버 트랜잭션은 요청이 수신될 때 코어에 의해 생성되며 해당 요청에 대한 트랜잭션 처리가 필요합니다(항상 그런 것은 아닙니다).
