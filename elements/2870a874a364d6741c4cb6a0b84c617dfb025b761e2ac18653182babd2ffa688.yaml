     As discussed in [RFC2975], real-time transfer of accounting records
     is a requirement, such as the need to perform credit-limit checks and
     fraud detection.  Note that batch accounting is not a requirement,
     and is therefore not supported by Diameter.  Should batched
     accounting be required in the future, a new Diameter application will
     need to be created, or it could be handled using another protocol.
     Note, however, that even if at the Diameter layer, accounting
     requests are processed one by one; transport protocols used under
     Diameter typically batch several requests in the same packet under
     heavy traffic conditions.  This may be sufficient for many
     applications.
