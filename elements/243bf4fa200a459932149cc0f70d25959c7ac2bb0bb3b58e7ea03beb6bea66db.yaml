          All routers run the exact same algorithm, in parallel.  From the
          link-state database, each router constructs a tree of shortest
          paths with itself as root.  This shortest-path tree gives the
          route to each destination in the Autonomous System.  Externally
          derived routing information appears on the tree as leaves.
