     This scenario shows example M3UA message flows for the establishment
     of traffic between an SGP and three ASPs in the same Application
     Server, where two of the ASPs are brought to the state ASP-ACTIVE and
     subsequently share the load.  In this case, a minimum of two ASPs are
     required to handle the total traffic load (2+1 sparing).
