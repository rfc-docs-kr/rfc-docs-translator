        The mandatory Local-RK-Identifier field is used to uniquely
        identify the registration request.  The Identifier value is
        assigned by the ASP and used to correlate the response in an REG
        RSP message with the original registration request.  The
        Identifier value must remain unique until the REG RSP message is
        received.
