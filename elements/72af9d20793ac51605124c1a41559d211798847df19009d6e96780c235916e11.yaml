     The combination of NAT functionality, ALGs and firewalls will provide
     a transparent working environment for a private networking domain.
     With the exception of RSIP, end-to-end network security assured by
     IPsec cannot be attained for end-hosts within the private network
     (Refer section 5.0 for RSIP operation). In all other cases, if you
     want to use end-to-end IPsec, there cannot be a NAT device in the
     path. If we make the assumption that NAT devices are part of a
     trusted boundary, tunnel mode IPsec can be accomplished with NAT
     router (or a combination of NAT, ALGs and firewall) serving as tunnel
     end point.
