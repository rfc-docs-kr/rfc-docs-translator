     The NIC should begin to hand out large blocks of class C addresses to
     network service providers.  Each block must fall on bit boundaries
     and should be large enough to serve the provider for two years.
     Further, the NIC should distribute very large blocks to continental
     and national network service organizations to allow additional levels
     of aggregation to take place at the major backbone networks.  In
     addition, the NIC should modify its procedures for the IN-ADDR.ARPA
     domain to permit delegation along arbitrary octet boundaries.
