     It is the responsibility of the requesting entity to provide
     suitable time outs for all outstanding transactions, and to retry
     transactions when time outs have been exceeded. Furthermore, when
     repeated transactions fail to be acknowledged, it is the
     responsibility of the requesting entity to seek redundant services
     and/or clear existing or pending connections.  Implementations SHALL
     ensure that the algorithm used to calculate retransmission timing
     performs an exponentially increasing backoff of the retransmission
     timeout for each retransmission or repetition after the first one.
