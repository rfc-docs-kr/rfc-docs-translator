     The optional Heartbeat procedures MAY be used when operating over
     transport layers that do not have their own heartbeat mechanism for
     detecting loss of the transport association (i.e., other than SCTP).
     Either M3UA peer may optionally send Heartbeat messages periodically,
     subject to a provisionable timer, T(beat).  Upon receiving a
     Heartbeat message, the M3UA peer MUST respond with a Heartbeat Ack
     message.
