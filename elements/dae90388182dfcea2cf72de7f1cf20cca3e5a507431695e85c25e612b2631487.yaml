     When no transport connection exists with a peer, an attempt to
     connect SHOULD be made periodically.  This behavior is handled via
     the Tc timer (see Section 12 for details), whose recommended value is
     30 seconds.  There are certain exceptions to this rule, such as when
     a peer has terminated the transport connection stating that it does
     not wish to communicate.
