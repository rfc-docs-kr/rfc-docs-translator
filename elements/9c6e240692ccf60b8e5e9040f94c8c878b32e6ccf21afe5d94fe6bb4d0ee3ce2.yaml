     When an inter-domain border router performs route aggregation, it
     needs to know the range of the block of IP addresses to be
     aggregated.  The basic principle is that it should aggregate as much
     as possible but not to aggregate those routes which cannot be treated
     as part of a single unit due to multi-homing, policy, or other
     constraints.
