     TerminationID in the input parameters represents the Termination that
     is being subtracted.  The TerminationID may be specific or may be a
     wildcard value indicating that all (or a set of related) Terminations
     in the Context of the Subtract Command are to be subtracted. If the
     wildcard matches more than one TerminationID, all possible matches
     are attempted, with results reported for each one. The order of
     attempts when multiple TerminationIDs match is not specified.
