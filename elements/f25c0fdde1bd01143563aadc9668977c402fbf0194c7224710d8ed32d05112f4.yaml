           o  If the URG bit is set, RCV.UP <- max(RCV.UP,SEG.UP), and
              signal the user that the remote side has urgent data if the
              urgent pointer (RCV.UP) is in advance of the data consumed.
              If the user has already been signaled (or is still in the
              "urgent mode") for this continuous sequence of urgent data,
              do not signal the user again.
