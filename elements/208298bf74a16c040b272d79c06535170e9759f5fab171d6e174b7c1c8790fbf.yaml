              If the router is not eligible to become Designated Router,
              it must periodically send Hello Packets to both the
              Designated Router and the Backup Designated Router (if they
              exist).  It must also send an Hello Packet in reply to an
              Hello Packet received from any eligible neighbor (other than
              the current Designated Router and Backup Designated Router).
              This is needed to establish an initial bidirectional
              relationship with any potential Designated Router.
