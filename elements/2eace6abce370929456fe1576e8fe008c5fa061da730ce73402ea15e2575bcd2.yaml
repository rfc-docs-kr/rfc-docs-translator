     IANA has created a new sub-registry "ICE Transport Protocols" in the
     "Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)" registry for ICE
     candidate-attribute transport extensions.  Initial values are given
     below; future assignments are to be made through IETF Review or IESG
     Approval [RFC5226].  Assignments consist of an extension token (as
     defined in Section 15.1 of [RFC5245]) and a reference to the document
     defining the extension.
