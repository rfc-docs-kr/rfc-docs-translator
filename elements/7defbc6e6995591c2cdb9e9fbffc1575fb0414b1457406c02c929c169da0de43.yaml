     When the output rate of a queue or scheduler must be limited to at
     most a specified maximum rate, this is done using the
     diffServMaxRateTable.  Rates may be expressed as absolute rates, or
     as a fraction of ifSpeed.  Only one of the Absolute or Relative rate
     needs to be set; the other takes the relevant value as a result.
