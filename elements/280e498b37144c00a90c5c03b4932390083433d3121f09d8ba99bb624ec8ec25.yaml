      Link State Origin
          Valid only for intra-area paths, this field indicates the LSA
          (router-LSA or network-LSA) that directly references the
          destination.  For example, if the destination is a transit
          network, this is the transit network's network-LSA.  If the
          destination is a stub network, this is the router-LSA for the
          attached router.  The LSA is discovered during the shortest-path
          tree calculation (see Section 16.1).  Multiple LSAs may
          reference the destination, however a tie-breaking scheme always
          reduces the choice to a single LSA. The Link State Origin field
          is not used by the OSPF protocol, but it is used by the routing
          table calculation in OSPF's Multicast routing extensions
          (MOSPF).
