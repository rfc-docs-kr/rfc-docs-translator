     A forwarding proxy or NAS MUST NOT modify existing Proxy-State,
     State, or Class attributes present in the packet.  The forwarding
     proxy or NAS MUST treat any Proxy-State attributes already in the
     packet as opaque data.  Its operation MUST NOT depend on the content
     of Proxy-State attributes added by previous proxies.  The forwarding
     proxy MUST NOT modify any other Proxy-State attributes that were in
     the packet; it may choose not to forward them, but it MUST NOT change
     their contents.  If the forwarding proxy omits the Proxy-State
     attributes in the request, it MUST attach them to the response before
     sending it.
