              IMPLEMENTATION:
                   The sender's SWS avoidance algorithm is more difficult
                   than the receivers's, because the sender does not know
                   (directly) the receiver's total buffer space RCV.BUFF.
                   An approach which has been found to work well is for
                   the sender to calculate Max(SND.WND), the maximum send
                   window it has seen so far on the connection, and to use
                   this value as an estimate of RCV.BUFF.  Unfortunately,
                   this can only be an estimate; the receiver may at any
                   time reduce the size of RCV.BUFF.  To avoid a resulting
                   deadlock, it is necessary to have a timeout to force
                   transmission of data, overriding the SWS avoidance
                   algorithm.  In practice, this timeout should seldom
                   occur.
