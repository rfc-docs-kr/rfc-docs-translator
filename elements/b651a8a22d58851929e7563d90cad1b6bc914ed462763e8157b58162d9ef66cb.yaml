     (Section 7.2) and RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (Section 8.2) have traditionally
     been employed together without any known bad interactions (indeed,
     this is the model introduced by PKCS #1 v1.5), such a combined use of
     an RSA key pair is NOT RECOMMENDED for new applications.

  (섹션 7.2) 및 RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 (섹션 8.2)는 전통적으로 알려진 나쁜 상호 작용 없이 함께 사용되었습니다(실제로 이는 PKCS #1 v1.5에서 도입된 모델입니다). RSA 키 쌍을 결합하여 사용합니다. 새로운 애플리케이션에는 권장되지 않습니다.
