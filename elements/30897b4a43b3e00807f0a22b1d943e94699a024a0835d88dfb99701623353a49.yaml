          Installing a new LSA in the database, either as the result of
          flooding or a newly self-originated LSA, may cause the OSPF
          routing table structure to be recalculated.  The contents of the
          new LSA should be compared to the old instance, if present.  If
          there is no difference, there is no need to recalculate the
          routing table. When comparing an LSA to its previous instance,
          the following are all considered to be differences in contents:
