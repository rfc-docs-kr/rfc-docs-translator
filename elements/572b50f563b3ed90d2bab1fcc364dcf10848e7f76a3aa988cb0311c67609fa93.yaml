     Authorization can be achieved, for example, by the configuration of a
     Diameter server Certification Authority (CA).  The server CA issues a
     certificate to the Diameter server, which includes an Object
     Identifier (OID) to indicate the subject is a Diameter server in the
     Extended Key Usage extension [RFC5280].  This certificate is then
     used during TLS/TCP, DTLS/SCTP, or IKE security negotiation.
     However, note that, at the time of writing, no Diameter server
     Certification Authorities exist.
