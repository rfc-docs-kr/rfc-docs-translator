     In the case of an Override mode AS, receipt of an ASP Active message
     at an SGP causes the (re)direction of all traffic for the AS to the
     ASP that sent the ASP Active message.  Any previously active ASP in
     the AS is now considered to be in the state ASP-INACTIVE and SHOULD
     no longer receive traffic from the SGP within the AS.  The SGP or
     IPSP then MUST send a Notify message ("Alternate ASP_Active") to the
     previously active ASP in the AS and SHOULD stop traffic to/from that
     ASP.  The ASP receiving this Notify MUST consider itself now in the
     ASP-INACTIVE state, if it is not already aware of this via inter-ASP
     communication with the Overriding ASP.
