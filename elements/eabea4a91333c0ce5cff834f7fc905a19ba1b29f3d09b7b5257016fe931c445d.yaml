     For packets outbound from the private network, NAPT would translate
     the source IP address, source transport identifier and related fields
     such as IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP header checksums. Transport identifier
     can be one of TCP/UDP port or ICMP query ID. For inbound packets, the
     destination IP address, destination transport identifier and the IP
     and transport header checksums are translated.
