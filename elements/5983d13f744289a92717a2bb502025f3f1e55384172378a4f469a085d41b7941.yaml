     The use of unicast ARP has a number of benefits.  One benefit is that
     unicast packets impose less burden on the network than broadcast
     packets, particularly on 802.11 networks where broadcast packets may
     be sent at rates as low as 1 Mb/sec.  Another benefit is that if the
     host is not on the link it hoped to find itself on, a broadcast ARP
     Request could pollute the ARP caches of peers on that link.  When
     using private addresses [RFC1918], another device could be
     legitimately using the same address, and a broadcast ARP Request
     could disrupt its communications, causing TCP connections to be
     broken, and similar problems.  Also, using a unicast ARP packet
     addressed to the MAC address of the router the host is expecting to
     find means that if the host is not on the expected link there will be
     no device with that MAC address, and the ARP packet will harmlessly
     disappear into the void without doing any damage.
