     Note that this plan neither requires nor assumes that already
     assigned addresses will be reassigned, though if doing so were
     possible, it would further reduce routing table sizes. It is assumed
     that routing technology will be capable of dealing with the current
     routing table size and with some reasonably small rate of growth.
     The emphasis of this plan is on significantly slowing the rate of
     this growth.
