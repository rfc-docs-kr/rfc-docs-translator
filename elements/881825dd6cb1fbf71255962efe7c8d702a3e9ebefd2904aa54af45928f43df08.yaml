              However, the values of R1 and R2 may be different for SYN
              and data segments.  In particular, R2 for a SYN segment MUST
              be set large enough to provide retransmission of the segment
              for at least 3 minutes.  The application can close the
              connection (i.e., give up on the open attempt) sooner, of
