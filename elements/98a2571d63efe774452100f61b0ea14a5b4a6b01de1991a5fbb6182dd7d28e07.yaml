     With EAP methods supporting one-way authentication, such as EAP-MD5,
     the peer does not authenticate the authenticator, making the peer
     vulnerable to attack by a rogue authenticator.  Methods supporting
     mutual authentication (as defined in Section 7.2.1) address this
     vulnerability.
