      DESCRIPTION
         "The maximum rate that a downstream scheduler element should
         allocate to this queue, relative to the maximum rate of the
         interface as reported by ifSpeed or ifHighSpeed, in units of
         1/1000 of 1. If the value is zero, then there is effectively no
         maximum rate limit and the scheduler should attempt to be work
         conserving for this queue. If the value is non-zero, the
         scheduler will limit the servicing of this queue to, at most,
         this rate in a non-work-conserving manner.
