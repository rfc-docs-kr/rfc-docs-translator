                Improper use of trailers can result in very confusing
                symptoms.  Only packets with specific size attributes are
                encapsulated using trailers, and typically only a small
                fraction of the packets being exchanged have these
                attributes.  Thus, if a system using trailers exchanges
                packets with a system that does not, some packets
                disappear into a black hole while others are delivered
                successfully.
