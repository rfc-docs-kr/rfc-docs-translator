         *  Short (minutes or less): This category includes packet-level
            processing functions and events that are recorded on the order
            of several round-trip times.  It also includes router
            mechanisms such as passive and active buffer management.  All
            of these mechanisms are used to control congestion or signal
            congestion to end systems so that they can adaptively regulate
            the rate at which traffic is injected into the network.  A
            well-known active queue management scheme, especially for
            responsive traffic such as TCP, is Random Early Detection
            (RED) [FLJA93].  During congestion (but before the queue is
            filled), the RED scheme chooses arriving packets to "mark"
            according to a probabilistic algorithm that takes into account
            the average queue size.  A router that does not utilize
            Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC3168] can simply
            drop marked packets to alleviate congestion and implicitly
            notify the receiver about the congestion.  On the other hand,
            if the router and the end hosts support ECN, they can set the
            ECN field in the packet header, and the end host can act on
            this information.  Several variations of RED have been
            proposed to support different drop precedence levels in multi-
            class environments [RFC2597].  RED provides congestion
            avoidance that is better than or equivalent to Tail-Drop (TD)
            queue management (drop arriving packets only when the queue is
            full).  Importantly, RED reduces the possibility of
            retransmission bursts becoming synchronized within the network
            and improves fairness among different responsive traffic
            sessions.  However, RED by itself cannot prevent congestion
            and unfairness caused by sources unresponsive to RED, e.g.,
            some misbehaved greedy connections.  Other schemes have been
            proposed to improve performance and fairness in the presence
            of unresponsive traffic.  Some of those schemes (such as
            Longest Queue Drop (LQD) and Dynamic Soft Partitioning with
            Random Drop (RND) [SLDC98]) were proposed as theoretical
            frameworks and are typically not available in existing
            commercial products, while others (such as Approximate Fair
            Dropping (AFD) [AFD03]) have seen some implementation.  Advice
            on the use of Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes is
            provided in [RFC7567].  [RFC7567] recommends self-tuning AQM
            algorithms like those that the IETF has published in
            [RFC8290], [RFC8033], [RFC8034], and [RFC9332], but RED is
            still appropriate for links with stable bandwidth, if
            configured carefully.
