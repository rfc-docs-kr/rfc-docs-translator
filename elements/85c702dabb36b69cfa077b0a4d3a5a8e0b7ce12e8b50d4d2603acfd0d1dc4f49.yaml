     Where the client successfully re-validates a previously obtained
     address using the INIT-REBOOT mechanism, the DHCP specification does
     not require the client to perform address conflict detection, so this
     seven-second delay does not apply.  However, the DHCP server may be
     slow to respond or may be down and not responding at all, so hosts
     could benefit from having an alternative way to quickly determine
     that a previously obtained address is valid for use on this
     particular link.
