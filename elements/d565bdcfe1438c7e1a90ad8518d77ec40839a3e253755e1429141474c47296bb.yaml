     Note that if a package contains a digit map completion event, then an
     event specification consisting of the package name with a wildcarded
     ItemID (Property Name) will activate a digit map if the event
     includes a digit map parameter.  Regardless of whether a digit map is
     activated, if the package also contains the digit events themselves,
     this form of event specification will cause the individual events to
     be reported to the MGC as they are detected.
