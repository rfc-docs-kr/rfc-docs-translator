     For each protocol, this document also contains an explicit set of
     requirements, recommendations, and options.  The reader must
     understand that the list of requirements in this document is
     incomplete by itself; the complete set of requirements for an
     Internet host is primarily defined in the standard protocol
     specification documents, with the corrections, amendments, and
     supplements contained in this RFC.
