     Version 1.0 of this capability was defined in [RFC4741].  Version 1.1
     is defined in this document, and extends version 1.0 by adding a new
     value, "test-only", to the <test-option> parameter of the
     <edit-config> operation.  For backwards compatibility with old
     clients, servers conforming to this specification MAY advertise
     version 1.0 in addition to version 1.1.
