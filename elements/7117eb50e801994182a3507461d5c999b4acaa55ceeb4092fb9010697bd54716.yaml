     If any two candidates have the same type-preference and direction-
     pref, they MUST have a unique other-pref.  With this specification,
     this usually only happens with multi-homed hosts, in which case
     other-pref is the preference for the particular IP address from which
     the candidate was obtained.  When there is only a single IP address,
     this value SHOULD be set to the maximum allowed value (8191).
