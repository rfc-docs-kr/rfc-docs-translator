     (Note 1) Where NAS or session identification attributes are included
     in Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request packets, they are used for
     identification purposes only.  These attributes MUST NOT be used for
     purposes other than identification (e.g., within CoA-Request packets
     to request authorization changes).
