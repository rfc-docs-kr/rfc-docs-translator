     The protocol is organized as a set of transactions, each of which is
     composed request and a response, commonly referred to as an
     acknowledgement.  The protocol messages, being carried over UDP, may
     be subject to losses. In the absence of a timely response,
     transactions are repeated. Entities are expected to keep in memory a
     list of the responses that they sent to recent transactions, i.e. a
     list of all the responses they sent over the last LONG-TIMER
     seconds, and a list of the transactions that are currently being
     executed.
