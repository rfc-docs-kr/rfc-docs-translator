     Managing dispersed serial line and modem pools for large numbers of
     users can create the need for significant administrative support.
     Since modem pools are by definition a link to the outside world, they
     require careful attention to security, authorization and accounting.
     This can be best achieved by managing a single "database" of users,
     which allows for authentication (verifying user name and password) as
     well as configuration information detailing the type of service to
     deliver to the user (for example, SLIP, PPP, telnet, rlogin).
