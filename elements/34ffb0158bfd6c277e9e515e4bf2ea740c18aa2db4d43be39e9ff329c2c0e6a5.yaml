        The important observation to be made here is that the additional
        connectivity due to such private links may be ignored for the
        purpose of IP address allocation, and do not pose a problem for
        routing. This is because the routing information associated with
        such connectivity is not propagated throughout the Internet, and
        therefore does not need to be collapsed into a TRD's prefix.
