     The implication of this is that, for any media stream protected by
     (D)TLS, the agent will first run ICE procedures, exchanging STUN
     messages.  Then, once ICE completes, (D)TLS procedures begin.  ICE
     and (D)TLS are thus "peers" in the protocol stack.  The STUN messages
     are not sent over the (D)TLS connection, even ones sent for the
     purposes of keepalive in the middle of the media session.
