     Diameter messages SHOULD be mapped into SCTP streams in a way that
     avoids head-of-the-line (HOL) blocking.  Among different ways of
     performing the mapping that fulfill this requirement it is
     RECOMMENDED that a Diameter node send every Diameter message (request
     or response) over stream zero with the unordered flag set.  However,
     Diameter nodes MAY select and implement other design alternatives for
     avoiding HOL blocking such as using multiple streams with the
     unordered flag cleared (as originally instructed in RFC 3588).  On
     the receiving side, a Diameter entity MUST be ready to receive
     Diameter messages over any stream, and it is free to return responses
     over a different stream.  This way, both sides manage the available
     streams in the sending direction, independently of the streams chosen
     by the other side to send a particular Diameter message.  These
     messages can be out-of-order and belong to different Diameter
     sessions.
