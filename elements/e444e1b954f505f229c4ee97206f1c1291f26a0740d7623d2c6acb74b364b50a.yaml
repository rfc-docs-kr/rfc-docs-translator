     When an SCTP association has been successfully established, the SCTP
     will send an SCTP-COMMUNICATION_UP notification primitive to the
     local M3UA layer.  At the SGP or IPSP that initiated the request, the
     M3UA layer will send an M-SCTP_ESTABLISH confirm primitive to Layer
     Management when the association setup is complete.  At the peer M3UA
     layer, an M-SCTP_ESTABLISH indication primitive is sent to Layer
     Management upon successful completion of an incoming SCTP association
     setup.
