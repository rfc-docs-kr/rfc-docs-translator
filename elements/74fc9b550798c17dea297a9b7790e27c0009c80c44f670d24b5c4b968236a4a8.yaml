     o  End-entity certificate matching: The transport sender or receiver
        is configured with information necessary to identify the valid
        end-entity certificates of its authorized peers.  The end-entity
        certificates can be self-signed, and no certification path
        validation is needed.  Implementations MUST support certificate
        fingerprints in Section 4.2.2 and MAY allow other formats for
        end-entity certificates such as a DER-encoded certificate.  This
        method provides an alternative to a PKI that is simple to deploy
        and still maintains a reasonable level of security.
