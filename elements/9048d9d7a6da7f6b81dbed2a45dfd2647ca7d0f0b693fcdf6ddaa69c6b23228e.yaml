          (2) If this step is reached, the stub network's routing table
              entry must be updated.  Calculate the set of next hops that
              would result from using the stub network link.  This
              calculation is shown in Section 16.1.1; input to this
              calculation is the destination (the stub network) and the
              parent vertex (the router vertex).  If the distance D is the
              same as the current routing table cost, simply add this set
              of next hops to the routing table entry's list of next hops.
              In this case, the routing table already has a Link State
              Origin.  If this Link State Origin is a router-LSA whose
              Link State ID is smaller than V's Router ID, reset the Link
              State Origin to V's router-LSA.
