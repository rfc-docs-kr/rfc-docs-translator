          NeighborChange
              There has been a change in the set of bidirectional
              neighbors associated with the interface.  The (Backup)
              Designated Router needs to be recalculated.  The following
              neighbor changes lead to the NeighborChange event.  For an
              explanation of neighbor states, see Section 10.1.
