         The key strength depends on the methods used to derive the keys.
         For instance, if keys are derived from a shared secret (such as a
         password or a long-term secret), and possibly some public
         information such as nonces, the effective key strength is limited
         by the strength of the long-term secret (assuming that the
         derivation procedure is computationally simple).  To take another
         example, when using public key algorithms, the strength of the
         symmetric key depends on the strength of the public keys used.
