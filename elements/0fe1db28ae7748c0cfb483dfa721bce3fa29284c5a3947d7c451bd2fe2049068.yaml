     The TerminationID specifies the Termination to be moved.  It may be
     wildcarded, but CHOOSE shall not be used in the TerminationID.  If
     the wildcard matches more than one TerminationID, all possible
     matches are attempted, with results reported for each one.  The order
     of attempts when multiple TerminationIDs match is not specified. By
     convention, the Termination is subtracted from its previous Context.
     The Context to which the Termination is moved is indicated by the
     target ContextId in the Action.  If the last remaining Termination is
     moved out of a Context, the Context is deleted.
