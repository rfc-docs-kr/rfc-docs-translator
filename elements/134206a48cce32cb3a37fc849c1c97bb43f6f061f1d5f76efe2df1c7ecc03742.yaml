     4. In some cases, an implicitly or explicitly wildcarded Subtract
        command that applies to a group of Terminations may step in front
        of a pending Add command.  The Media Gateway Controller should
        individually delete all Terminations for which an Add command was
        pending at the time of the global Subtract command.  Also, new Add
        commands for Terminations named by the wild-carding (or implied in
        a Multiplex descriptor) should not be sent until the wild-carded
        Subtract command is acknowledged.
