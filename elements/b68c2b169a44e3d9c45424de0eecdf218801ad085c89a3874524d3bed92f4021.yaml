     For weighted scheduling methods, one can say loosely, that WRR
     focuses on meeting bandwidth sharing, without concern for relative
     delay amongst the queues; where WFQ controls both queue the service
     order and the amount of traffic serviced, providing bandwidth sharing
     and relative delay ordering amongst the queues.
