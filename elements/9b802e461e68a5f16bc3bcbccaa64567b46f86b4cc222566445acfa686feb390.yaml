     For this reason, a Diameter peer must employ logic separate from the
     state machine to receive connection requests, accept them, and await
     the CER.  Once the CER arrives on a new connection, the Origin-Host
     that identifies the peer is used to locate the state machine
     associated with that peer, and the new connection and CER are passed
     to the state machine as an R-Conn-CER event.
