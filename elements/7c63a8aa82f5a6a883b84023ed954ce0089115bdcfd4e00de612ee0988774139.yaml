                For example, consider a valid_policy_tree with a node of
                depth i-1 where the expected_policy_set is {Gold, Silver}.
                Assume anyPolicy appears in the certificate policies
                extension of certificate i with no policy qualifiers, but
                Gold and Silver do not appear.  This rule will generate
                two child nodes of depth i, one for each policy.  The
                result is shown below as Figure 6.
