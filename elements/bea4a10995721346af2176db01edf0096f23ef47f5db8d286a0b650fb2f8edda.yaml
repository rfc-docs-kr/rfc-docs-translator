          This section is equally applicable to the flooding of an LSA
          that the router itself has just originated (see Section 12.4).
          For these LSAs, this section provides the entirety of the
          flooding procedure (i.e., the processing of Section 13 is not
          performed, since, for example, the LSA has not been received
          from a neighbor and therefore does not need to be acknowledged).
