         In the headDrop(3) algorithm, if a packet arrives when the
         current depth of the queue, pointed to by
         diffServAlgDropQMeasure, is at diffServAlgDropQThreshold, packets
         currently at the head of the queue are dropped to make room for
         the new packet to be enqueued at the tail of the queue.
