     It should be noted that the syslog transport specified in this
     document does not use application-layer acknowledgments.  TCP uses
     retransmissions to provide protection against some forms of data
     loss.  However, if the TCP connection (or TLS session) is broken for
     some reason (or closed by the transport receiver), the syslog
     transport sender cannot always know what messages were successfully
     delivered to the syslog application at the other end.
