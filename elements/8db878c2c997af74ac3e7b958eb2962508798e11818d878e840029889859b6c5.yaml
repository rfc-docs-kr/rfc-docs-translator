     If the SGP determines that the received RK was already registered,
     fully and exactly, either statically or dynamically, by the sending
     ASP, the SGP returns a Registration Response message to the ASP,
     containing a Registration Result "Error - Routing Key Already
     Registered".  This error applies whether the sending ASP/IPSP is in
     ASP-ACTIVE or ASP-INACTIVE for the corresponding AS.  For this error
     code, the RC field in the Registration Response message MUST be
     populated with the actual value of RC in SGP corresponding to the
     specified RK in the Registration Request message.
