     Port 465 is presently used for two purposes: for submissions by a
     large number of clients and service providers and for the "urd"
     protocol by one vendor.  Actually documenting this current state is
     controversial, as discussed in the IANA Considerations section.
     However, there is no good alternative.  Registering a new port for
     submissions when port 465 is already widely used for that purpose
     will just create interoperability problems.  Registering a port
     that's only used if advertised by an SRV record (RFC 6186) would not
     create interoperability problems but would require all client
     deployments, server deployments, and software to change
     significantly, which is contrary to the goal of promoting the
     increased use of TLS.  Encouraging the use of STARTTLS on port 587
     would not create interoperability problems, but it is unlikely to
     have any impact on the current undocumented use of port 465 and makes
     the guidance in this document less consistent.  The remaining option
     is to document the current state of the world and support future use
     of port 465 for submission, as this increases consistency and ease of
     deployment for TLS email submission.
