     Similarly, routing and forwarding tables in layer-3 network equipment
     must be organized to store both prefix and prefix length or mask.
     Equipment that organizes its routing/forwarding information according
     to legacy Class A/B/C network/subnet conventions cannot be expected
     to work correctly on networks connected to the global Internet; use
     of such equipment is not recommended.  Fortunately, very little such
     equipment is in use today.
