     Key derivation
        This refers to the ability of the EAP method to derive exportable
        keying material, such as the Master Session Key (MSK), and
        Extended Master Session Key (EMSK).  The MSK is used only for
        further key derivation, not directly for protection of the EAP
        conversation or subsequent data.  Use of the EMSK is reserved.
