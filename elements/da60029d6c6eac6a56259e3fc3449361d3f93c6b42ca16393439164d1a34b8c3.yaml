          Waiting
              In this state, the router is trying to determine the
              identity of the (Backup) Designated Router for the network.
              To do this, the router monitors the Hello Packets it
              receives.  The router is not allowed to elect a Backup
              Designated Router nor a Designated Router until it
              transitions out of Waiting state.  This prevents unnecessary
              changes of (Backup) Designated Router.
