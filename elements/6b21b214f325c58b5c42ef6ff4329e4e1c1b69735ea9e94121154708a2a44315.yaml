              The checksum is used to detect data corruption of an LSA.
              This corruption can occur while an LSA is being flooded, or
              while it is being held in a router's memory.  The LS
              checksum field cannot take on the value of zero; the
              occurrence of such a value should be considered a checksum
              failure.  In other words, calculation of the checksum is not
              optional.
