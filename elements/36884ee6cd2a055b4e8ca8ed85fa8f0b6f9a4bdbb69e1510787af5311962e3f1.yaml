     NAT binds addresses in private network with addresses in global
     network and vice versa to provide transparent routing for the
     datagrams traversing between address realms. The binding in some
     cases may extend to transport level identifiers (such as TCP/UDP
     ports). Address binding is done at the start of a session. The
     following sub-sections describe two types of address assignments.
