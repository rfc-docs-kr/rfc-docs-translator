     Server implementations may wish to refuse to process the CCC command
     on a session that has not passed through some form of client
     authentication (e.g., TLS client auth or FTP USER/PASS).  This can
     prevent anonymous clients from repeatedly requesting AUTH TLS
     followed by CCC to tie up resources on the server.
