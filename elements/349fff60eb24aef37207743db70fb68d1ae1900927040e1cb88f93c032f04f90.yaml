        While [RFC3162] defines the use of IPsec with RADIUS, support for
        IPsec is not required.  In order to provide universal support for
        transmission-level security, and enable both intra- and inter-
        domain AAA deployments, Diameter provides support for TLS/TCP and
        DTLS/SCTP.  Security is discussed in Section 13.
