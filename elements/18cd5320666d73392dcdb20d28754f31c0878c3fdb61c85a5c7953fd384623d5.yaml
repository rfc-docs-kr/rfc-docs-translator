     As an example, it can be usually be assumed that duplicates appear
     within a time window of longest recorded network partition or device
     fault, perhaps a day.  So only records within this time window need
     to be looked at in the backward direction.  Secondly, hashing
     techniques or other schemes, such as the use of the T flag in the
     received messages, may be used to eliminate the need to do a full
     search even in this set except for rare cases.
