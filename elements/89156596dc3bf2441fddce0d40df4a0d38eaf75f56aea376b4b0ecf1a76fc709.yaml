     An Abort-Session-Answer (ASA) command is sent in response to an ASR
     in order to indicate the disposition of the request.  A
     Diameter/RADIUS gateway receiving a Disconnect-ACK translates this to
     an ASA command with a Result-Code AVP of "DIAMETER_SUCCESS".  A
     Disconnect-NAK received from the NAS is translated to an ASA command
     with a Result-Code AVP that depends on the value of the Error-Cause
     Attribute.  Suggested translations between Error-Cause Attribute
     values and Result-Code AVP values are included below:
