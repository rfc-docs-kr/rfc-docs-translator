     Because JPEG frames are typically larger than the underlying
     network's maximum packet size, frames must often be fragmented into
     several packets.  One approach is to allow the network layer below
     RTP (e.g., IP) to perform the fragmentation.  However, this precludes
     rate-controlling the resulting packet stream or partial delivery in
     the presence of loss, and frames may be larger than the maximum
     network layer reassembly length (see [10] for more information).  To
     avoid these limitations, RTP/JPEG defines a simple fragmentation and
     reassembly scheme at the RTP level.
