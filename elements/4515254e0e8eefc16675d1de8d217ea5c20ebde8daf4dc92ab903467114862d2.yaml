     IPsec deployment in host-to-host environments has been slow.  Unlike
     application security systems such as TLS, adding IPsec to a non-IPsec
     system generally involves changing the operating system, either by
     modifying with the kernel or installing new drivers.  This is a
     substantially greater undertaking than simply installing a new
     application.  However, recent versions of a number of commodity
     operating systems include IPsec stacks, so deployment is becoming
     easier.

  호스트 간 환경의 IPsec 배포가 느렸습니다. TLS와 같은 응용 프로그램 보안 시스템과 달리 IPsec을 비 IPsec 시스템에 추가하려면 일반적으로 커널을 수정하거나 새 드라이버를 설치하여 운영 체제를 변경해야 합니다. 이는 단순히 새 애플리케이션을 설치하는 것보다 훨씬 더 큰 작업입니다. 그러나 여러 상용 운영 체제의 최신 버전에는 IPsec 스택이 포함되어 있으므로 배포가 더욱 쉬워지고 있습니다.
