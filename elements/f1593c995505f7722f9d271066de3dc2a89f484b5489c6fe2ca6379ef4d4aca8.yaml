     An access device that is unable to interpret or apply a deny rule
     MUST terminate the session.  An access device that is unable to
     interpret or apply a permit rule MAY apply a more restrictive rule.
     An access device MAY apply deny rules of its own before the supplied
     rules, for example to protect the access device owner's
     infrastructure.
