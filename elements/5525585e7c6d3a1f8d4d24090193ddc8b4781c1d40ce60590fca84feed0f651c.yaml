     That is to say, it does not matter which side initiates the
     connection with a connect() call or which side reacts to the
     connection via the accept() call; the FTP client, as defined in
     [RFC-959], is always the TLS client, as defined in [RFC-2246].

  즉, 어느 쪽이 connect() 호출로 연결을 시작하는지, 어느 쪽이 accept() 호출을 통해 연결에 반응하는지는 중요하지 않습니다. [RFC-959]에 정의된 FTP 클라이언트는 [RFC-2246]에 정의된 대로 항상 TLS 클라이언트입니다.
