     Data-Oriented Network Architecture (DONA) [DONA] and CCN [Jacobson09]
     [Smetters09] integrate most of the data needed to verify provenance
     into all content retrievals but need to be able to retrieve
     additional information (typically a security certificate) in order to
     complete the provenance authentication.  Whether the application has
     any control of this extra retrieval will depend on the
     implementation.  CCN is explicitly designed to handle dynamic content
     allowing names to be pre-allocated and attached to subsequently
     generated content.  DONA offers variants for dynamic and immutable
     content.
