     One way to view broadcasting is as an imperfect substitute for
     multicasting, the sending of messages to a subset of the hosts on a
     network.  In practice, broadcasts are usually used where multicasts
     are what is wanted; packets are broadcast at the hardware level, but
     filtering software in the receiving hosts gives the effect of
     multicasting.
