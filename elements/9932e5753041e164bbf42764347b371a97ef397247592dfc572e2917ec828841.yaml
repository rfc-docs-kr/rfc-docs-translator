     The MSK and EMSK MUST NOT be used directly to protect data; however,
     they are of sufficient size to enable derivation of a AAA-Key
     subsequently used to derive Transient Session Keys (TSKs) for use
     with the selected ciphersuite.  Each ciphersuite is responsible for
     specifying how to derive the TSKs from the AAA-Key.
