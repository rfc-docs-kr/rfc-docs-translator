     Implementation Note: The peer MAY obtain the Identity via user input.
     It is suggested that the authenticator retry the Identity Request in
     the case of an invalid Identity or authentication failure to allow
     for potential typos on the part of the user.  It is suggested that
     the Identity Request be retried a minimum of 3 times before
     terminating the authentication.  The Notification Request MAY be used
     to indicate an invalid authentication attempt prior to transmitting a
     new Identity Request (optionally, the failure MAY be indicated within
     the message of the new Identity Request itself).
