              This field is the checksum of the complete contents of the
              LSA, excepting the LS age field.  The LS age field is
              excepted so that an LSA's age can be incremented without
              updating the checksum.  The checksum used is the same that
              is used for ISO connectionless datagrams; it is commonly
              referred to as the Fletcher checksum.  It is documented in
              Annex B of [Ref6].  The LSA header also contains the length
              of the LSA in bytes; subtracting the size of the LS age
              field (two bytes) yields the amount of data to checksum.
