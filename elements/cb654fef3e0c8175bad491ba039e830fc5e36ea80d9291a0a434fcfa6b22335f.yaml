        For example, suppose that Europe is assigned a prefix of
        <194.0.0.0 254.0.0.0>, such that European routing also contains
        the longer prefixes <194.1.0.0 255.255.0.0> and <194.2.0.0
        255.255.0.0>.  All of the longer European prefixes may be
        advertised across a trans-Atlantic link to North America.  The
        router in North America would then aggregate these routes, and
        only advertise the prefix <194.0.0.0 255.0.0.0> into North
        American routing.  Packets which are destined for 194.1.1.1 would
        traverse North American routing, but would encounter the North
        American router which performed the European aggregation.  If the
        prefix <194.1.0.0 255.255.0.0> is unreachable, the router would
        drop the packet and send an ICMP Unreachable without using the
        trans-Atlantic link.
