     It is expected that the generic threat model and corresponding
     security claims will used to define EAP method requirements for use
     in specific environments.  An example of such a requirements analysis
     is provided in [IEEE-802.11i-req].  A security claims section is
     required in EAP method specifications, so that EAP methods can be
     evaluated against the requirements.
