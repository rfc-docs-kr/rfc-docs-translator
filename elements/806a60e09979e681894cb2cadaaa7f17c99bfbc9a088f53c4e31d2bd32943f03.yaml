        The PROT command, as specified in [RFC-2228], allows client/server
        negotiation of the security level of the data connection.  Once a
        PROT command has been issued by the client and accepted by the
        server returning the '200' reply, the security of subsequent data
        connections MUST be at that level until another PROT command is
        issued and accepted; the session ends and a REIN command is
        issued, or the security of the session (via an AUTH command) is
        re-negotiated.
