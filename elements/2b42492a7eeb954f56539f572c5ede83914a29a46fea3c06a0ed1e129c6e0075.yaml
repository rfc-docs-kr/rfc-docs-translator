     The "Destination Status Unknown" error MAY be sent if a DAUD is
     received at an SG enquiring of the availability/congestion status of
     a destination and the SG does not wish to provide the status (e.g.,
     the sender is not authorized to know the status).  For this error,
     the invalid or unauthorized Point Code(s) MUST be included along with
     the Network Appearance and/or Routing Context associated with the
     Point Code(s).
