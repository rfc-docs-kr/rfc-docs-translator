     The simplest connection we can imagine is where the local HOST acts as
     if it is a TTY and has dialed up the remote HOST.  After some
     consideration of the problems of initiating and terminating such a
     connection , it has been decided to reserve link 0 for communication
     between HOST operating systems.  The remaining 31 links are thus to be
     used as dial-up lines.

  우리가 상상할 수 있는 가장 간단한 연결은 로컬 HOST가 마치 TTY인 것처럼 작동하고 원격 HOST에 전화 접속하는 경우입니다. 이러한 연결을 시작하고 종료하는 데 따른 문제를 고려한 후 HOST 운영 체제 간의 통신을 위해 링크 0을 예약하기로 결정했습니다. 따라서 나머지 31개 링크는 전화 접속 회선으로 사용됩니다.
