          For example, an IP subnetted network might be configured as a
          single OSPF area.  In that case, a single address range could be
          configured:  a class A, B, or C network number along with its
          natural IP mask.  Inside the area, any number of variable sized
          subnets could be defined.  However, external to the area a
          single route for the entire subnetted network would be
          distributed, hiding even the fact that the network is subnetted
          at all.  The cost of this route is the maximum of the set of
          costs to the component subnets.
