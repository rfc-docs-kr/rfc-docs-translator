              An application program MUST be able to specify the IP source
              address to be used for sending a UDP datagram or to leave it
              unspecified (in which case the networking software will
              choose an appropriate source address).  There SHOULD be a
              way to communicate the chosen source address up to the
              application layer (e.g, so that the application can later
              receive a reply datagram only from the corresponding
              interface).
