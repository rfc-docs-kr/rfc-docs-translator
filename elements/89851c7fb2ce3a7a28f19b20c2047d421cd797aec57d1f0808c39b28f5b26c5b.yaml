        Known Unregistered Use:  It's known that the assignment or range
              is in use without having been defined in accordance with
              reasonable practice.  Documentation for use of the
              assignment or range may be unavailable, inadequate, or
              conflicting.  This is a warning against use, as well as an
              alert to network operators who might see these values in use
              on their networks.
