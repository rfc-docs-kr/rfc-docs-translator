        that continent can only reside on that continent.  Alternatively,
        if continental aggregation is done on the "far" side of an inter-
        continental link, the "far" end can perform the aggregation and
        inject it into continental routing.  This means that destinations
        which are part of the continental aggregation, but for which there
        is not a corresponding more specific prefix can be rejected before
        leaving the continent on which they originated.
