     The TerminationID may be specific if a single Termination in the
     Context is to be modified.  Use of wildcards in the TerminationID may
     be appropriate for some operations. If the wildcard matches more than
     one TerminationID, all possible matches are attempted, with results
     reported for each one.  The order of attempts when multiple
     TerminationIDs match is not specified. The CHOOSE option is an error,
     as the Modify command may only be used on existing Terminations.
