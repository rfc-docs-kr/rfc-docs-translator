          Using this authentication type, a 64-bit field is configured on
          a per-network basis.  All packets sent on a particular network
          must have this configured value in their OSPF header 64-bit
          authentication field.  This essentially serves as a "clear" 64-
          bit password. In addition, the entire contents of each OSPF
          packet (other than the 64-bit authentication field) are
          checksummed in order to detect data corruption.
