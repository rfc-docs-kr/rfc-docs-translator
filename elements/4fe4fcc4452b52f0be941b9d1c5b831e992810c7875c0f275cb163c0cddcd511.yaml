      LSAs are flooded throughout the area.  The flooding algorithm is
      reliable, ensuring that all routers in an area have exactly the same
      link-state database.  This database consists of the collection of
      LSAs originated by each router belonging to the area.  From this
      database each router calculates a shortest-path tree, with itself as
      root.  This shortest-path tree in turn yields a routing table for
      the protocol.
