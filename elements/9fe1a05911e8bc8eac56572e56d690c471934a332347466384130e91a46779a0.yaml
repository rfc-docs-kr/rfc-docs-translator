     If the TLS negotiation fails or if the client receives a 454
     response, the client has to decide what to do next.  There are three
     main choices: go ahead with the rest of the SMTP session, retry TLS
     at a later time, or give up and return the mail to the sender.  If a
     failure or error occurs, the client can assume that the server may be
     able to negotiate TLS in the future, and should try negotiate TLS in
     a later session, until some locally-chosen timeout occurs, at which
     point, the client should return the mail to the sender.  However, if
     the client and server were only using TLS for authentication, the
     client may want to proceed with the SMTP session, in case some of the
     operations the client wanted to perform are accepted by the server
     even if the client is unauthenticated.
