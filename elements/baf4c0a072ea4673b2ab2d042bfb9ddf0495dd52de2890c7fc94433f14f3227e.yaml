     This document defines the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP),
     an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication
     methods.  EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as
     Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP.  EAP
     provides its own support for duplicate elimination and
     retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees.
     Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual
     EAP methods may support this.
