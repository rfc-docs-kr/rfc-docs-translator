     sequential signal list contains signals of type timeout and the
     trailing element is not of type on/off, the type of the sequential
     signal list SHALL be set to timeout.  The duration of a sequential
     signal list with type timeout is the sum of the durations of the
     signals it contains.  If the sequence of signals in a sequential
     signal list contains only signals of type brief, the type of the
     sequential signal list SHALL be set to brief.  A signal list is
     treated as a single signal of the specified type when played out.
