     - If (1) the RC parameter is not included in the ASP Active message,
       (2) there are RKs defined (by either static configuration or
       dynamic registration) and (3) RC is not mandatory, the peer node
       MUST respond with an ASP Active Ack message if it is ready to
       handle traffic; otherwise, it will send an ERROR message with the
       Error Code "No Configured AS for ASP" (meaning that it is not ready
       to become active).
