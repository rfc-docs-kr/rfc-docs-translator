        The Network Appearance parameter value is of local significance
        only, coordinated between the SGP and ASP.  Therefore, in the case
        where an ASP is connected to more than one SGP, the same SS7
        network context may be identified by different Network Appearance
        values, depending on which SGP a message is being transmitted/
        received.
