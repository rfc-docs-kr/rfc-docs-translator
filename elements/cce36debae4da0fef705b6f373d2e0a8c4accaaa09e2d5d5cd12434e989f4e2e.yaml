     Rule #2 guarantees that no routing loops form due to aggregation.
     Consider a site that has been assigned 192.168.64/19 by its "parent"
     provider, which has 192.168.0.0/16.  The "parent" network will
     advertise 192.168.0.0/16 to the "child" network.  If the "child"
     network were to lose internal connectivity to 192.168.65.0/24 (which
     is part of its aggregate), traffic from the "parent" to the to the
     "child" destined for 192.168.65.1 will follow the "child's"
     advertised route.  When that traffic gets to the "child", however,
     the child *must not* follow the route 192.168.0.0/16 back up to the
     "parent", since that would result in a forwarding loop.  Rule #2 says
