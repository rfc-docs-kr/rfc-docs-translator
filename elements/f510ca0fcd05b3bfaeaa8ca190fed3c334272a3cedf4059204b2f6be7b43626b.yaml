     Properties, Events, Signals and Statistics defined in Packages, as
     well as parameters to them, are referenced by identifiers (Ids).
     Identifiers are scoped. For each package, PropertyIds, EventIds,
     SignalIds, StatisticsIds and ParameterIds have unique name spaces and
     the same identifier may be used in each of them.  Two PropertyIds in
     different packages may also have the same identifier, etc.
