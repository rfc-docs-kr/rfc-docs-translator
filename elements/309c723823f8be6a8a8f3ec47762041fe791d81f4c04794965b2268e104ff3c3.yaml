           This flag is set after a link failover procedure, to aid the
           removal of duplicate requests.  It is set when resending
           requests not yet acknowledged, as an indication of a possible
           duplicate due to a link failure.  This bit MUST be cleared when
           sending a request for the first time; otherwise, the sender
           MUST set this flag.  Diameter agents only need to be concerned
           about the number of requests they send based on a single
           received request; retransmissions by other entities need not be
           tracked.  Diameter agents that receive a request with the T
           flag set, MUST keep the T flag set in the forwarded request.
           This flag MUST NOT be set if an error answer message (e.g., a
           protocol error) has been received for the earlier message.  It
           can be set only in cases where no answer has been received from
           the server for a request, and the request has been sent again.
           This flag MUST NOT be set in answer messages.
