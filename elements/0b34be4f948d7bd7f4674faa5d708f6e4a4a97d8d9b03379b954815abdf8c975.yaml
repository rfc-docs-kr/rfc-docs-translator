     When an ASP Up message is received at an SGP and, internally, the
     remote ASP is in the ASP-DOWN state and is not considered locked out
     for local management reasons, the SGP marks the remote ASP in the
     state ASP-INACTIVE and informs Layer Management with an M-ASP_Up
     indication primitive.  If the SGP is aware, via current configuration
     data, which Application Servers the ASP is configured to operate in,
     the SGP updates the ASP state to ASP-INACTIVE in each AS that it is a
     member.
