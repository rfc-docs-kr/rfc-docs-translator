     | '4'       | 'staple': Bind the Document(s) with one or more       |
     |           | staples.  The exact number and placement of the       |

     |           | in the finished Document.  The exact number and       |
     |           | placement of the holes are site defined.  The punch   |
     |           | specification MAY be satisfied (in a site-specific    |
     |           | and implementation-specific manner) either by         |
     |           | drilling/punching or by substituting pre-drilled      |
     |           | media.                                                |

     |           | specification of a printed cover (on cover stock      |
     |           | medium) by the Document itself.                       |
     +-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+

     |           | middle fold are implementation defined and/or site    |
     |           | defined.                                              |
