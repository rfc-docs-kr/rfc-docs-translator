              Some TCP implementations have included a FLUSH call, which
              will empty the TCP send queue of any data for which the user
              has issued SEND calls but which is still to the right of the
              current send window.  That is, it flushes as much queued
              send data as possible without losing sequence number
              synchronization.  This is useful for implementing the "abort
              output" function of Telnet.
