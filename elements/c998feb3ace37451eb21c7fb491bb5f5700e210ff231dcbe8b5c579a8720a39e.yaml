     Note, there is no guarantee that the idea of a session, determined as
     above by NAT, will coincide with the application's idea of a session.
     An application might view a bundle of sessions (as viewed by NAT) as
     a single session and might not even view its communication with its
     peers as a session. Not all applications are guaranteed to work
     across realms, even with an ALG (defined below in section 2.9)
     enroute.
