     For routing domains which are not attached to any publically
     available TRD, there is not the same urgent need for hierarchical
     address abbreviation. We do not, therefore, make any additional
     recommendations for such "isolated" routing domains.  Where such
     domains are connected to other domains by private point-to-point
     links, and where such links are used solely for routing between the
     two domains that they interconnect, again no additional technical
     problems relating to address abbreviation is caused by such a link,
     and no specific additional recommendations are necessary.
