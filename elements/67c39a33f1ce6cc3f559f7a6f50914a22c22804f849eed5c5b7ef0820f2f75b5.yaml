        |  Note: This list was assembled from the set of registered TLS
        |  cipher suites when [RFC7540] was developed.  This list includes
        |  those cipher suites that do not offer an ephemeral key exchange
        |  and those that are based on the TLS null, stream, or block
        |  cipher type (as defined in Section 6.2.3 of [TLS12]).
        |  Additional cipher suites with these properties could be
        |  defined; these would not be explicitly prohibited.
