     o  An organization that changes service provider but does not
        renumber.  This has the effect of "punching a hole" in one of the
        original service provider's aggregated route advertisements.  CIDR
        handles this situation by requiring that the newer service
        provider to advertise a specific advertisement for the re-homed
        organization; this advertisement is preferred over provider
        aggregates because it is a longer match.  To maintain efficiency
        of aggregation, it is recommended that an organization that
        changes service providers plan eventually to migrate its network
        into a an prefix assigned from its new provider's address space.
        To this end, it is recommended that mechanisms to facilitate such
        migration, such as dynamic host address assignment that uses
        [RFC2131]), be deployed wherever possible, and that additional
        protocol work be done to develop improved technology for
        renumbering.
