     When a configuration change requires updates across a number of
     devices, care needs to be taken to provide the required transaction
     semantics.  The NETCONF protocol contains sufficient primitives upon
     which transaction-oriented operations can be built.  Providing
     complete transactional semantics across multiple devices is
     prohibitively expensive, but the size and number of windows for
     failure scenarios can be reduced.
