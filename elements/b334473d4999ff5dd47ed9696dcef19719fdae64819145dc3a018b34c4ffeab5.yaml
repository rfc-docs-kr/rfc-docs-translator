     The RequestID returns the RequestID parameter of the EventsDescriptor
     that triggered the Notify Command.  It is used to correlate the
     notification with the request that triggered it.  The events in the
     list must have been requested via the triggering EventsDescriptor or
     embedded events descriptor unless the RequestID is 0 (which is for
     further study).
