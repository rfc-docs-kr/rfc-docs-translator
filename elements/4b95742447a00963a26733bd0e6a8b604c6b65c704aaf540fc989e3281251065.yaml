     [b] Security claims.  This is a statement of the claimed security
         properties of the method, using terms defined in Section 7.2.1:
         mutual authentication, integrity protection, replay protection,
         confidentiality, key derivation, dictionary attack resistance,
         fast reconnect, cryptographic binding.  The Security Claims
         section of an EAP method specification SHOULD provide
         justification for the claims that are made.  This can be
         accomplished by including a proof in an Appendix, or including a
         reference to a proof.
