     The Diameter base protocol is intended to provide an Authentication,
     Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework for applications such
     as network access or IP mobility in both local and roaming
     situations.  This document specifies the message format, transport,
     error reporting, accounting, and security services used by all
     Diameter applications.  The Diameter base protocol as defined in this
     document obsoletes RFC 3588 and RFC 5719, and it must be supported by
     all new Diameter implementations.
