              (d)  TCP SHOULD inform the application of the delivery
                   problem (unless such information has been disabled by
                   the application; see Section 4.2.4.1), when R1 is
                   reached and before R2.  This will allow a remote login
                   (User Telnet) application program to inform the user,
                   for example.
