     o  Locally configured names MAY contain the wildcard character to
        match a range of values.  The types of wildcards supported MAY be
        more flexible than those allowed in subject names, making it
        possible to support various policies for different environments.
        For example, a policy could allow for a trust-root-based
        authorization where all credentials issued by a particular CA
        trust root are authorized.
