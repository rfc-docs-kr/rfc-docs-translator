     [b] Requiring cryptographic binding between the EAP tunneling
         protocol and the tunneled EAP methods.  Where cryptographic
         binding is supported, a mechanism is also needed to protect
         against downgrade attacks that would bypass it.  For further
         details on cryptographic binding, see [BINDING].
