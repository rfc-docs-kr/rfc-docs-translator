     If Accept has a non-zero value, results of all TWAMP-Test sessions
     spawned by this TWAMP-Control session SHOULD be considered invalid.
     If the Accept-Session message was not transmitted at all (for
     whatever reason, including failure of the TCP connection used for
     TWAMP-Control), the results of all TWAMP-Test sessions spawned by
     this TWAMP-Control session MAY be considered invalid.
