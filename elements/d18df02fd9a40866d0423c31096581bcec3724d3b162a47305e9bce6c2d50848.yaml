          Non-broadcast networks
              Networks supporting many (more than two) routers, but having
              no broadcast capability.  Neighboring routers are maintained
              on these nets using OSPF's Hello Protocol.  However, due to
              the lack of broadcast capability, some configuration
              information may be necessary to aid in the discovery of
              neighbors.  On non-broadcast networks, OSPF protocol packets
              that are normally multicast need to be sent to each
              neighboring router, in turn. An X.25 Public Data Network
              (PDN) is an example of a non-broadcast network.
