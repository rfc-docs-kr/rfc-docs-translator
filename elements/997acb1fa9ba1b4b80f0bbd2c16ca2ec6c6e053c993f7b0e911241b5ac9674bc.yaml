        The Expanded Nak Type is only sent when the Request contains an
        Expanded Type (254) as defined in Section 5.7.  The Vendor-Data
        field of the Nak Response MUST contain one or more authentication
        Types (4 or greater), all in expanded format, 8 octets per Type,
        or the value zero (0), also in Expanded Type format, to indicate
        no proposed alternative.  The desired authentication Types may
        include a mixture of Vendor-Specific and IETF Types.  For example,
        an Expanded Nak Response indicating a preference for OTP (Type 5),
        and an MIT (Vendor-Id=20) Expanded Type of 6 would appear as
        follows:
