     [4] The conversation continues until the authenticator cannot
         authenticate the peer (unacceptable Responses to one or more
         Requests), in which case the authenticator implementation MUST
         transmit an EAP Failure (Code 4).  Alternatively, the
         authentication conversation can continue until the authenticator
         determines that successful authentication has occurred, in which
         case the authenticator MUST transmit an EAP Success (Code 3).
