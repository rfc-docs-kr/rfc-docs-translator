     A Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP MUST contain exactly one of
     either Auth-Application-Id or Acct-Application-Id.  If a Vendor-
     Specific-Application-Id is received without one of these two AVPs,
     then the recipient SHOULD issue an answer with a Result-Code set to
     DIAMETER_MISSING_AVP.  The answer SHOULD also include a Failed-AVP,
     which MUST contain an example of an Auth-Application-Id AVP and an
     Acct-Application-Id AVP.
