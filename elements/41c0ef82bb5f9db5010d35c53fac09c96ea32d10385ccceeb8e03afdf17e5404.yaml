        A multi-session represents a logical linking of several sessions.
        Multi-sessions are tracked by using the Acct-Multi-Session-Id.  An
        example of a multi-session would be a Multi-link PPP bundle.  Each
        leg of the bundle would be a session while the entire bundle would
        be a multi-session.
