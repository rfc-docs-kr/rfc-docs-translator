     The impact of CCN on privacy has been investigated in [Lauinger10],
     and the analysis is applicable to all ICN architectures because it is
     mostly focused on the common caching aspect.  The privacy risks of
     Named Data Networking are also highlighted in [Lauinger12].  Further
     work on privacy in ICNs can be found in [Chaabane13].  Finally,
     Fotiou et al. define an ICN privacy evaluation framework in
     [Fotiou14].
