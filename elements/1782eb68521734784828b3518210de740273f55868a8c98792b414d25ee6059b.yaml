     To allow connectivity between the General Switched Telephone Network
     facsimile service (GSTN fax) and the e-mail-based Internet Fax
     service (i-fax) an "Internet Fax Gateway" is required.  This document
     provides recommendations for the functionality of Internet Fax
     Gateways.  In this context, an "offramp gateway" provides facsimile
     data transmission from i-fax to GSTN fax; vice versa, an "onramp
     gateway" provides data transmission form GSTN fax to i-fax.  The
     recommendations in this document apply to the integrated service
     including Internet Fax terminals, computers with i-fax software on
     the Internet, and GSTN Fax terminals on the GSTN.
