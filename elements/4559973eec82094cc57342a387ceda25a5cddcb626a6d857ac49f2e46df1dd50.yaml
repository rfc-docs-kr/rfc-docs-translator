     exchange completes while application messages are still in transit,
     resulting in a loss of these messages.  An implementation could
     mitigate this race condition, for example, using timers, and wait for
     a short period of time for pending application level messages to
     arrive before proceeding to disconnect the transport connection.
     Eventually, lost messages are handled by the retransmission mechanism
     described in Section 5.5.4.
