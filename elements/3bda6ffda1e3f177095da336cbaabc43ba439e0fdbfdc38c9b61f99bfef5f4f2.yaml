        This temptation must be resisted.  An ARP server should never
        respond to a request whose target is a broadcast address.  Such a
        request can only come from a host that does not recognize the
        broadcast address as such, and so honoring it would almost
        certainly lead to a forwarding loop.  If there are N such hosts on
        the physical network that do not recognize this address as a
        broadcast, then a datagram sent with a Time-To-Live of T could
        potentially give rise to T**N spurious re-broadcasts.
