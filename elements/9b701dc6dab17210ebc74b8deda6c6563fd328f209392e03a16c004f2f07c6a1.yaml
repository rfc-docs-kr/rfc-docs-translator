     The M3UA layer at an ASP or IPSP MAY indicate local congestion to an
     M3UA peer with an SCON message.  When an SG receives a congestion
     message (SCON) from an ASP and the SG determines that an SPMC is now
     encountering congestion, it MAY trigger SS7 MTP3 Transfer Controlled
     management messages to concerned SS7 destinations according to
     congestion procedures of the relevant MTP3 standard.
