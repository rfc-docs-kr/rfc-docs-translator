     EventBuffer returns the set of events and associated parameter values
     currently enabled in the EventBufferDescriptor. PackagesDescriptor
     returns a list of packages realized by the Termination.
     DigitMapDescriptor returns the name or value of the current DigitMap
     for the Termination.  DigitMap requested in an AuditValue command
     with TerminationID ALL returns all DigitMaps in the gateway.
     Statistics returns the current values of all statistics being kept on
     the Termination.  Specifying an empty Audit Descriptor results in
     only the TerminationID being returned.  This may be useful to get a
     list of TerminationIDs when used with wildcard.  Annexes A and B
     provide a special syntax for presenting such a list in condensed
     form, such that the AuditValue command tag does not have to be
     repeated for each TerminationID.
