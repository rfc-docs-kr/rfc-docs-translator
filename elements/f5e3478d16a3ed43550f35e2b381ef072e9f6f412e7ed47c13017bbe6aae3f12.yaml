     If the server is using a site certificate, the domain name in the
     NAPTR query and the domain name in the replacement field MUST both be
     valid based on the site certificate handed out by the server in the
     TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP or Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE)
     exchange.  Similarly, the domain name in the SRV query and the domain
     name in the target in the SRV record MUST both be valid based on the
     same site certificate.  Otherwise, an attacker could modify the DNS
     records to contain replacement values in a different domain, and the
     client could not validate whether this was the desired behavior or
     the result of an attack.
