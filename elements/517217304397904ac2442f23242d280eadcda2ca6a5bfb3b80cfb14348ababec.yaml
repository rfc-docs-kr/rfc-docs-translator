     If we further assume that there are approximately 100 service
     providers, then each service provider will also need to advertise its
     block of addresses.  However, due to aggregation, these
     advertisements will be reduced to only 100 additional routes.  We
     assume that after the initial two years, new service providers
     combined with additional requests from existing providers will
     require an additional 50 routes per year.  Thus, the total is 4700 +
     800 + 150 = 5650.  This represents an annual growth rate of
     approximately 6%.  This is in clear contrast to the current annual
     growth of 130%.  This analysis also assumes an immediate deployment
     of this plan with full compliance. Note that this analysis assumes
     only a single level of route aggregation in the current Internet -
     intelligent address allocation should significantly improve this.
