          There is a virtual link configured between Routers RT10 and
          RT11.  Without this configured virtual link, RT11 would be
          unable to advertise a route for networks N9-N11 and Host H1 into
          the backbone, and there would not be an entry for these networks
          in Router RT4's routing table.
