     An implementation following these rules should also be generalized,
     so that an arbitrary network number and mask are accepted for all
     routing destinations.  The only outstanding constraint is that the
     mask must be left contiguous.  Note that the degenerate route 0.0.0.0
     mask 0.0.0.0 is used as a default route and MUST be accepted by all
     implementations.  Further, to protect against accidental
     advertisements of this route via the inter-domain protocol, this
     route should never be advertised unless there is specific
     configuration information indicating to do so.
