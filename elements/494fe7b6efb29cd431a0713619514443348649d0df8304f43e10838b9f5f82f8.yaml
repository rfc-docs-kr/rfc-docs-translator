     In the case where a Notify message ("AS-PENDING") message is sent by
     an SGP that now has no ASPs active to service the traffic, or where a
     Notify ("Insufficient ASP resources active in AS") message is sent in
     the Loadshare or Broadcast mode, the Notify message does not
     explicitly compel the ASP(s) receiving the message to become active.
     The ASPs remain in control of what (and when) traffic action is
     taken.
