     [2] Support for tie-breaking in the lower layer.  Lower layers such
         as IEEE 802.11 ad hoc do not support "tie breaking" wherein two
         hosts initiating authentication with each other will only go
         forward with a single authentication.  This implies that even if
         802.11 were to support a bi-directional group-key handshake, then
         two authentications, one in each direction, might still occur.
