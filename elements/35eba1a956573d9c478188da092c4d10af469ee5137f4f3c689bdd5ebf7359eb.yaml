     The NAS responds to a Disconnect-Request packet sent by a Dynamic
     Authorization Client with a Disconnect-ACK if all associated session
     context is discarded and the user session(s) are no longer connected,
     or a Disconnect-NAK, if the NAS was unable to disconnect one or more
     sessions and discard all associated session context.  A Disconnect-
     ACK MAY contain the Acct-Terminate-Cause (49) Attribute [RFC2866]
     with the value set to 6 for Admin-Reset.
