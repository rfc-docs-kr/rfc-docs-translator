     The NAT function cannot by itself support all applications
     transparently and often must co-exist with application level gateways
     (ALGs) for this reason. People looking to deploy NAT based solutions
     need to determine their application requirements first and assess the
     NAT extensions (i.e., ALGs) necessary to provide application
     transparency for their environment.
