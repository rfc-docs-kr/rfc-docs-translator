        The dynamic address discovery procedure is to broadcast an ARP
        request.  To limit the number of all rings broadcasts to a
        minimum, it is desirable (though not required) that an ARP request
        first be sent as an all-stations broadcast, without a Routing
        Information Field (RIF).  If the all-stations (local ring)
        broadcast is not supported or if the all-stations broadcast is
        unsuccessful after some reasonable time has elapsed, then send the
        ARP request as an all-routes or single-route broadcast with an
        empty RIF (no routing designators).  An all-routes broadcast is
        preferable since it yields an amount of fault tolerance.  In an
        environment with multiple redundant bridges, all-routes broadcast
        allows operation in spite of spanning-tree bridge failures.
        However, single-route broadcasts may be used if IP and ARP must
        use the same broadcast method.
