              (1) The checksum field in the OSPF header must be verified.
                  It must be set to the 16-bit one's complement of the
                  one's complement sum of all the 16-bit words in the
                  packet, excepting the authentication field.  (If the
                  packet's length is not an integral number of 16-bit
                  words, the packet is padded with a byte of zero before
                  checksumming.)
