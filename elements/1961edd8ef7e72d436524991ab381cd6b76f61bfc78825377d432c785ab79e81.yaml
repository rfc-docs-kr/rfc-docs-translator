                   If host receives a datagram containing a completed
                   source route (i.e., the pointer points beyond the last
                   field), the datagram has reached its final destination;
                   the option as received (the recorded route) MUST be
                   passed up to the transport layer (or to ICMP message
                   processing).  This recorded route will be reversed and
                   used to form a return source route for reply datagrams
                   (see discussion of IP Options in Section 4).  When a
                   return source route is built, it MUST be correctly
                   formed even if the recorded route included the source
                   host (see case (B) in the discussion below).
