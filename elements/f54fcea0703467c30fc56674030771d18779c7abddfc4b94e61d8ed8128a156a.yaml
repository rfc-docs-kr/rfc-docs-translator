        With the third approach, each multi-homed organization in the
        widget group would make use of an address assignment based on its
        other attachment(s) to TRDs (the attachments not associated with
        the widget group). The widget backbone would need to maintain
        routes to the routing domains associated with the various member
        organizations.  Similarly, all members of the widget group would
        need to maintain a table of routes to the other members via the
        widget backbone.  However, since the widget backbone does not
        inform other general worldwide TRDs of what addresses it can reach
        (since the backbone is not intended for use by other outside
        organizations), the relatively large set of routing prefixes needs
        to be maintained only in a limited number of places. The addresses
        assigned to the various organizations which are members of the
        widget group would provide a "default route" via each members
        other attachments to TRDs, while allowing communications within
        the widget group to use the preferred path.
