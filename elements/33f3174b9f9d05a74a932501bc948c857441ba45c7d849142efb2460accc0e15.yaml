     1.  Traffic can be hijacked by advertising a prefix for a given
         destination that is more specific than the aggregate that is
         normally advertised for that destination.  For example, assume
         that a popular end system with the address 192.168.17.100 is
         connected to a service provider that advertises 192.168.16.0/20.
         A malicious network operator interested in intercepting traffic
         for this site might advertise, or at least attempt to advertise,
         192.168.17.0/24 into the global routing system.  Because this
         prefix is more specific than the "normal" prefix, traffic will be
         diverted away from the legitimate end system and to the network
         owned by the malicious operator.  Prior to the advent of CIDR, it
         was possible to induce traffic from some parts of the network to
         follow a false advertisement that exactly matched a particular
         network number; CIDR makes this problem somewhat worse, since
         longest-match routing generally causes all traffic to prefer
         more-specific routes over less-specific routes.  The remedy for
         the CIDR-based attack, though, is the same as for a pre-CIDR-
         based attack: establishment of trust relationships between
         providers, coupled with and strong route policy filters at
         provider borders.  Unfortunately, the implementation of such
         filters is difficult in the highly de-centralized Internet.  As a
         workaround, many providers do implement generic filters that set
         upper bounds, derived from RIR guidelines for the sizes of blocks
         that they allocate, on the lengths of prefixes that are accepted
         from other providers.  Note that "spammers" have been observed
         using this sort of attack to hijack address space temporarily in
         order to hide the origin of the traffic ("spam" email messages)
         that they generate.
