     To illustrate the problem diagnosis issue mentioned in Section 5.1,
     consider what happens if PA loses connectivity to C7 (the site that
     is assigned out of PB's space).  In a stateful protocol, PA will
     announce to BB that 10.32.0.0/20 has become unreachable.  Now, when
     BB flushes this information out of its routing table, any future
     traffic sent through it for this destination will be forwarded to PB
     (where it will be dropped according to Rule #2) by virtue of PB's
     less-specific match, 10.32.0.0/13.  Although this does not cause an
     operational problem (C7 is unreachable in any case), it does create
     some extra traffic across "BB" (and may also prove confusing to
     someone trying to debug the outage with "traceroute").  A mechanism
     to cache such unreachable state might be nice, but it is beyond the
     scope of this document.
