     If the Event-Timestamp Attribute is included, it represents the time
     at which the original packet was sent, and therefore it SHOULD NOT be
     updated when the packet is retransmitted.  If the Event-Timestamp
     Attribute is not updated, this implies that the Identifier is not
     changed in retransmitted packets.  As a result, the ability to detect
     replay within the time window is dependent on support for duplicate
     detection within that same window.  As noted in Section 2.3,
     duplicate detection is REQUIRED for Dynamic Authorization Servers
     implementing this specification.
