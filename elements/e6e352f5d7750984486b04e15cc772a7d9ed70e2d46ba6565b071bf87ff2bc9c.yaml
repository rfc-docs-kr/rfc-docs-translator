              A host MAY send a Source Quench message if it is
              approaching, or has reached, the point at which it is forced
              to discard incoming datagrams due to a shortage of
              reassembly buffers or other resources.  See Section 2.2.3 of
              [INTRO:2] for suggestions on when to send Source Quench.
