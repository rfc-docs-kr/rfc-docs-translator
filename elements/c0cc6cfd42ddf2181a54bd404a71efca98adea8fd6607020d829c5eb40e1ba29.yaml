     While result indications may enable synchronization of the
     authentication result between the peer and server, this does not
     guarantee that the peer and authenticator will be synchronized in
     terms of their authorization or that timeouts will not occur.  For
     example, the EAP server may not be aware of an authorization decision
     made by a AAA proxy; the AAA server may check authorization only
     after authentication has completed successfully, to discover that
     authorization cannot be granted, or the AAA server may grant access
     but the authenticator may be unable to provide it due to a temporary
     lack of resources.  In these situations, synchronization may only be
     achieved via lower layer result indications.
