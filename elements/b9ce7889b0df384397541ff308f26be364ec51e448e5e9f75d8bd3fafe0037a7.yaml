     In this example, the SGP contains an instance of the SS7 SCCP
     protocol layer that may, for example, perform the SCCP Global Title
     Translation (GTT) function for messages logically addressed to the SG
     SCCP.  If the result of a GTT for an SCCP message yields an SS7 DPC
     or DPC/SSN address of an SCCP peer located in the IP domain, the
     resulting MTP-TRANSFER request primitive is sent to the local M3UA-
     resident network address translation and mapping function for ongoing
     routing to the final IP destination.
