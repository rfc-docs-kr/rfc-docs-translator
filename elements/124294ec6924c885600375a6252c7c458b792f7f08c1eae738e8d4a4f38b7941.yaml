     A sentence pointing to a pending document that further addresses IANA
     considerations was added to section 2.13.  The current draft of that
     document is draft-iesg-iana-considerations-02.txt.  A clause stating
     that the IANA established the assignment policies was removed since it
     appeared to conflict with the intent of the referenced ID.
     Placeholders for the BCP and RFC number have been added to the text
     and reference section.

  IANA 고려 사항을 추가로 다루는 계류 중인 문서를 가리키는 문장이 섹션 2.13에 추가되었습니다. 해당 문서의 현재 초안은draft-iesg-iana-considerations-02.txt입니다. IANA가 할당 정책을 수립했다는 조항은 참조된 ID의 의도와 충돌하는 것으로 보이므로 삭제되었습니다. BCP 및 RFC 번호에 대한 자리 표시자가 텍스트 및 참조 섹션에 추가되었습니다.
