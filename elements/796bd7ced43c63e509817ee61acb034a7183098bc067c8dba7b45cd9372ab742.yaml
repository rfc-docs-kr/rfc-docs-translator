     TCP provides ordered delivery of transactions.  No special
     procedures are required.  It should be noted that ALF/UDP allows
     sending entity to modify its behavior under congestion, and in
     particular, could reorder transactions when congestion is
     encountered.  TCP could not achieve the same results.
