     Consider the block of 524288 (2^19) addresses, beginning with
     10.24.0.0 and ending with 10.31.255.255, allocated to a single
     network provider, "PA".  This is equivalent in size to a block of
     2048 legacy "Class C" network numbers (or /24s).  A classless route
     to this block would be described as 10.24.0.0 with a mask of
     255.248.0.0 and the prefix 10.24.0.0/13.
