     The Heartbeat Data parameter contents are defined by the sending
     node.  The Heartbeat Data could include, for example, a Heartbeat
     Sequence Number and/or Timestamp.  The receiver of a BEAT message
     does not process this field, as it is only of significance to the
     sender.  The receiver MUST respond with a BEAT Ack message.
