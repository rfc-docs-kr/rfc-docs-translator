     Alternatively, should the routing domain draw IP addresses for all
     the hosts within the domain from a single IP address prefix, boundary
     routing information can be summarized into the single IP address
     prefix.  This permits substantial data reduction and allows better
     scaling (as compared to the uncoordinated addressing discussed in the
     previous paragraph).
