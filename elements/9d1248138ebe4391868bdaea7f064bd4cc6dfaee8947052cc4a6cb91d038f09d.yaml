              An attempt to open a TCP connection could fail with
              excessive retransmissions of the SYN segment or by receipt
              of a RST segment or an ICMP Port Unreachable.  SYN
              retransmissions MUST be handled in the general way just
              described for data retransmissions, including notification
              of the application layer.
