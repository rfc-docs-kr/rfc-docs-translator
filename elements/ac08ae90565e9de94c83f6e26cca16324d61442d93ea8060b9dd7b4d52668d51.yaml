     This memo does not address the use of TLS with SMTP for message relay
     (where Message Submission [RFC6409] does not apply).  Improving the
     use of TLS with SMTP for message relay requires a different approach.
     One approach to address that topic is described in [RFC7672]; another
     is provided in [MTA-STS].
