          The above discussion has been simplified by considering only a
          single route to any destination.  In reality, if multiple
          equal-cost routes to a destination exist, they are all
          discovered and used.  This requires no conceptual changes to the
          algorithm, and its discussion is postponed until we consider the
          tree-building process in more detail.
