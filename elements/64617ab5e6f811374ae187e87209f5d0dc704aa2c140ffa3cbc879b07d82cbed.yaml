     It is also worthwhile to mention that since aggregation may occur at
     multiple levels in the system, it may still be possible to aggregate
     these anomalous routes at higher levels of whatever hierarchy may be
     present. For example, if a site is multi-homed to two NSFNET regional
     networks both of whom obtain their address space from the NSFNET,
     then aggregation by the NSFNET of routes from the regionals will
     include all routes to the multi-homed site.
