     A delegated credential (DC) is a digitally signed data structure with
     two semantic fields: a validity interval and a public key (along with
     its associated signature algorithm).  The signature on the delegated
     credential indicates a delegation from the certificate that is issued
     to the peer.  The private key used to sign a credential corresponds
     to the public key of the peer's X.509 end-entity certificate
     [RFC5280].  Figure 1 shows the intended deployment architecture.
