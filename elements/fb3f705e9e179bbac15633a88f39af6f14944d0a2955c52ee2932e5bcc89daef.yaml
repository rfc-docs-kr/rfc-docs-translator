     When CIDR was originally deployed, the central assignment authority
     continued to exist but changed its procedures to assign large blocks
     of "Class C" network numbers to each service provider.  Each service
     provider, in turn, assigned bitmask-oriented subsets of the
     provider's address space to each customer.  This worked reasonably
     well, as long as the number of service providers was relatively small
     and relatively constant, but it did not scale well, as the number of
     service providers grew at a rapid rate.
