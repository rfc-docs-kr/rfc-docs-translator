     The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation
     of a header field to its single line representation is called
     "unfolding". Unfolding is accomplished by simply removing any CRLF
     that is immediately followed by WSP.  Each header field should be
     treated in its unfolded form for further syntactic and semantic
     evaluation.

  헤더 필드의 접힌 여러 줄 표현에서 한 줄 표현으로 이동하는 프로세스를 "펼침"이라고 합니다. WSP 바로 뒤에 오는 CRLF를 제거하면 전개가 완료됩니다.  각 헤더 필드는 추가 구문 및 의미 평가를 위해 펼쳐진 형식으로 처리되어야 합니다.
