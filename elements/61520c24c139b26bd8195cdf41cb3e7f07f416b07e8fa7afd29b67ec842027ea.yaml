          Virtual links are used to restore/increase connectivity of the
          backbone.  Virtual links may be configured between any pair of
          area border routers having interfaces to a common (non-backbone)
          area.  The virtual link appears as an unnumbered point-to-point
          link in the graph for the backbone.  The virtual link must be
          configured in both of the area border routers.
