          IP interface mask
              Also referred to as the subnet/network mask, this indicates
              the portion of the IP interface address that identifies the
              attached network.  Masking the IP interface address with the
              IP interface mask yields the IP network number of the
              attached network.  On point-to-point networks and virtual
              links, the IP interface mask is not defined. On these
              networks, the link itself is not assigned an IP network
              number, and so the addresses of each side of the link are
              assigned independently, if they are assigned at all.
