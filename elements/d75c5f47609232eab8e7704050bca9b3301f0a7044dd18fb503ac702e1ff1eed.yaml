     When no data is received from a connection for a long time (where the
     application decides what "long" means), a transport receiver MAY
     close the connection.  The transport receiver (TLS server) MUST
     attempt to initiate an exchange of close_notify alerts with the
     transport sender before closing the connection.  Transport receivers
     that are unprepared to receive any more data MAY close the connection
     after sending the close_notify alert, thus generating an incomplete
     close on the transport sender side.
