     Since EAP is a peer-to-peer protocol, an independent and simultaneous
     authentication may take place in the reverse direction (depending on
     the capabilities of the lower layer).  Both ends of the link may act
     as authenticators and peers at the same time.  In this case, it is
     necessary for both ends to implement EAP authenticator and peer
     layers.  In addition, the EAP method implementations on both peers
     must support both authenticator and peer functionality.
