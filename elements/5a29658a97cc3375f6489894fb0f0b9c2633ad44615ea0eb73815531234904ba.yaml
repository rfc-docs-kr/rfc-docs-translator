     The example provided in Figure 3 depicts a request issued from the
     access device, NAS, for the user bob@example.com.  The message is
     forwarded by the NAS to its relay, DRL, which does not have a routing
     entry in its Diameter routing table for example.com.  The DRL has a
     default route configured to DRD, which is a redirect agent that
     returns a redirect notification to DRL, as well as the HMS' contact
     information.  Upon receipt of the redirect notification, the DRL
     establishes a transport connection with the HMS, if one doesn't
     already exist, and forwards the request to it.
