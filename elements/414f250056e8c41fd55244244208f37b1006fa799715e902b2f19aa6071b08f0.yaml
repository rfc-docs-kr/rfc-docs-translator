     There are circumstances in which it may be desirable to protect the
     control connection only during part of the session and then to revert
     back to a plaintext connection.  This is often due to the limitations
     of boundary devices such as NAT and firewalls, which expect to be
     able to examine the content of the control connection in order to
     modify their behaviour.
