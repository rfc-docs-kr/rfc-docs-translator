     Additionally, various specific metrics are also critical in
     constrained environments, such as processing requirements, signaling
     overhead, and memory allocation for caching procedures, in addition
     to power consumption and battery lifetime.  For gateways (which
     typically act as a point of service to a large number of nodes and
     have to satisfy the information requests from remote entities), we
     need to consider scalability-related metrics, such as frequency and
     processing of successfully satisfied information requests.
