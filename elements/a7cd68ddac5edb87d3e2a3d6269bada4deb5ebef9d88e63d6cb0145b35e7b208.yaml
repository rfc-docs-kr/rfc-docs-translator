     o  Simplified security requirements.  The use of a secured transport
        for exchanging Diameter messages remains mandatory.  However, TLS/
        TCP and DTLS/SCTP have become the primary methods of securing
        Diameter with IPsec as a secondary alternative.  See Section 13
        for details.  The support for the End-to-End security framework
        (E2E-Sequence AVP and 'P'-bit in the AVP header) has also been
        deprecated.
