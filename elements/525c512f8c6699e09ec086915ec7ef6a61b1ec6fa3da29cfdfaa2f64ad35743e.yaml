     o  For compatibility with existing MUAs and existing MUA
        configurations, MSPs SHOULD also, in the near term, provide
        instances of these services that support STARTTLS.  This will
        permit legacy MUAs to discover new availability of TLS capability
        on servers and may increase the use of TLS by such MUAs.  However,
        servers SHOULD NOT advertise STARTTLS if the use of the STARTTLS
        command by a client is likely to fail (for example, if the server
        has no server certificate configured).
