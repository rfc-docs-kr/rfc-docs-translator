     Alternately, packets may be tunneled between RSAP-IP-Client and
     RSAP-IP-Server such that RSAP-IP-Server would detunnel packets
     outbound from RSAP-IP-Clients and forward to external hosts. On the
     return path, RSAP-IP-Server  would locate RSAP-IP-Client tunnel,
     based on the tuple of (destination address, transport Identifier) and
     encapsulate the original packet within a tunnel to forward to RSAP-
     IP-Client. With this approach, there is no limitation on the
     tunneling technique employed between RSAP-IP-Client and RSAP-IP-
     Server. However, there are limitations to applying IPsec based
     security on end-to-end packets.  Transport mode based authentication
     and integrity may be attained.  But, confidentiality cannot be
     permitted because RSAP-IP-Server must be able to examine the
     destination transport Identifier in order to identify the RSAP-IP-
     tunnel to forward inbound packets to. For this reason, only the
     transport mode TCP, UDP and ICMP packets protected by AH and ESP-
     authentication can traverse a RSAP-IP-Server using this approach.
