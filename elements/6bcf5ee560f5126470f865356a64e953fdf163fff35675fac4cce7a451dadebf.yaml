     It is important to note that Diameter agents MUST support at least
     one of the LOCAL, RELAY, PROXY, or REDIRECT modes of operation.
     Agents do not need to support all modes of operation in order to
     conform with the protocol specification, but they MUST follow the
     protocol compliance guidelines in Section 2.  Relay agents and
     proxies MUST NOT reorder AVPs.
