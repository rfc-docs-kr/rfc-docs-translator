     There are many other miscellaneous fixes that have been introduced in
     this document that may not be considered significant, but they have
     value nonetheless.  Examples are removal of obsolete types, fixes to
     the state machine, clarification of the election process, message
     validation, fixes to Failed-AVP and Result-Code AVP values, etc.  All
     of the errata filed against RFC 3588 prior to the publication of this
     document have been addressed.  A comprehensive list of changes is not
     shown here for practical reasons.
