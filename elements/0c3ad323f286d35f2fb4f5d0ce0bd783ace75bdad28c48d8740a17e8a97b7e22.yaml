     In general, if a Token Bucket has N rates, it has N+1 potential
     outcomes - the traffic stream is slower than and therefore conforms
     to all of the rates, it fails the first few but is slower than and
     therefore conforms to the higher rates, or it fails all of them.  As
     such, multi-rate meters should specify those rates in monotonically
     increasing order, passing through the diffServMeterFailNext from more
     committed to more excess rates, and finally falling through
     diffServMeterFailNext to the set of actions that apply to traffic
     which conforms to none of the specified rates.  diffServTBParamType
     in the first entry indicates the algorithm being used.  At each rate,
     diffServTBParamRate is derivable from diffServTBParamBurstSize and
     diffServTBParamInterval; a superior implementation will allow the
