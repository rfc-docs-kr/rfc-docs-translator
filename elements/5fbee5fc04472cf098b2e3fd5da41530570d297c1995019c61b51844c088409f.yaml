     to 20 megabit/second, the 802.4 standard specifies 1, 5, and 10
     megabit/second, and the 802.5 standard specifies 1 and 4
     megabit/second.  The typical transmission rates used are 10
     megabit/second for 802.3, 10 megabit/second for 802.4, and 4
     megabit/second for 802.5.  However, this specification for the
     transmission of IP Datagrams does not depend on the transmission
     rate.
