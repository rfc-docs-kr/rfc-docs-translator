     For representing a Strict Priority scheduler, each scheduler input is
     assigned a priority with respect to all the other inputs feeding the
     same scheduler, with default values for the other parameters.
     Higher-priority traffic that is not being delayed for shaping will be
     serviced before a lower-priority input.  An example is found in
     Figure 2.
