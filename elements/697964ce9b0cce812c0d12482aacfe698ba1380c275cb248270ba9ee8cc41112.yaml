        The Length field is two octets and indicates the length, in
        octets, of the EAP packet including the Code, Identifier, Length,
        and Data fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length field
        should be treated as Data Link Layer padding and MUST be ignored
        upon reception.  A message with the Length field set to a value
        larger than the number of received octets MUST be silently
        discarded.
