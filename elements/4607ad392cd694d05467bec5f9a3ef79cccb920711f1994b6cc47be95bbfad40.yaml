     A common container is shared by all testbed users, and a user
     container is assigned to one testbed user.  A common container has a
     global IP address to connect with other containers or external
     networks, whereas each user container uses a private IP address and a
     user space providing a closed networking environment.  A user can
     login to his/her user containers using SSH with his/her certificate,
     or access them from PCs connected to the Internet using SSH
     tunneling.
