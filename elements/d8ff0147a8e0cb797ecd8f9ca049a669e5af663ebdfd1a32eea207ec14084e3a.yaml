              A router also indicates whether it is an area border router,
              or an AS boundary router, by setting the appropriate bits
              (bit B and bit E, respectively) in its router-LSAs. This
              enables paths to those types of routers to be saved in the
              routing table, for later processing of summary-LSAs and AS-
              external-LSAs.  Bit B should be set whenever the router is
              actively attached to two or more areas, even if the router
              is not currently attached to the OSPF backbone area.  Bit E
              should never be set in a router-LSA for a stub area (stub
              areas cannot contain AS boundary routers).
