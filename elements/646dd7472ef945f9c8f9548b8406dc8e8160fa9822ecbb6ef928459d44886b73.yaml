         *  Preventive (predictive/avoidance) policies take proactive
            action to prevent congestion based on estimates and
            predictions of future congestion problems (e.g., traffic
            matrix forecasts).  Some of the policies described for the
            long and medium timescales fall into this category.
            Preventive policies do not necessarily respond immediately to
            existing congestion problems.  Instead, forecasts of traffic
            demand and workload distribution are considered, and action
            may be taken to prevent potential future congestion problems.
            The schemes described for the short timescale can also be used
            for congestion avoidance because dropping or marking packets
            before queues actually overflow would trigger corresponding
            responsive traffic sources to slow down.  Preventive
            congestion management schemes may also be reactive.
