     The server MUST send the delegated credential as an extension in the
     CertificateEntry of its end-entity certificate; the client MUST NOT
     use delegated credentials sent as extensions to any other
     certificate, and SHOULD ignore them, but MAY abort the handshake with
     an "illegal_parameter" alert.  If the server sends multiple delegated
     credentials extensions in a single CertificateEntry, the client MUST
     abort the handshake with an "illegal_parameter" alert.
