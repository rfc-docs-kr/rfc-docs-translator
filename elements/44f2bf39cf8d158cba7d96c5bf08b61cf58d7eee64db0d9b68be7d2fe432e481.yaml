     If the receiver of the GOAWAY has sent data on streams with a higher
     stream identifier than what is indicated in the GOAWAY frame, those
     streams are not or will not be processed.  The receiver of the GOAWAY
     frame can treat the streams as though they had never been created at
     all, thereby allowing those streams to be retried later on a new
     connection.

  GOAWAY의 수신자가 GOAWAY 프레임에 표시된 것보다 더 높은 스트림 식별자를 가진 스트림에 데이터를 보낸 경우 해당 스트림은 처리되지 않거나 처리되지 않습니다. GOAWAY 프레임의 수신자는 스트림을 전혀 생성되지 않은 것처럼 처리하여 나중에 새 연결에서 해당 스트림을 재시도할 수 있습니다.
