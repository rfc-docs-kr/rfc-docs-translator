     S/MIME and OpenPGP can also be used to encrypt a message.  A signed
     or encrypted message is protected while transported along the
     network; however, when a message reaches an Internet Fax Gateway,
     either onramp or offramp, this kind of protection cannot be applied
     anymore.  Here, security must rely on trusted operations of the
     gateway itself.  A gateway might have its own certificate/key to
     improve security operations when sending Internet Faxes, but, as with
     any gateway, it breaks the end-to-end security pattern of both S/MIME
     and PGP.
