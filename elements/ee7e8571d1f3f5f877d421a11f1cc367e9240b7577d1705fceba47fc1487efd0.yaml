     -  A SMTP client would probably only want to authenticate an SMTP
        server whose server certificate has a domain name that is the
        domain name that the client thought it was connecting to.
     -  A publicly-referenced  SMTP server would probably want to accept
        any verifiable certificate from an SMTP client, and would possibly
        want to put distinguishing information about the certificate in
        the Received header of messages that were relayed or submitted
        from the client.
