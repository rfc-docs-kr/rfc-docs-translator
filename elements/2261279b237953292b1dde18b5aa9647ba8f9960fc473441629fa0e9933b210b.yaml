          OSPF attaches an IP address mask to each advertised route.  The
          mask indicates the range of addresses being described by the
          particular route.  For example, a summary-LSA for the
          destination 128.185.0.0 with a mask of 0xffff0000 actually is
          describing a single route to the collection of destinations
          128.185.0.0 - 128.185.255.255.  Similarly, host routes are
          always advertised with a mask of 0xffffffff, indicating the
          presence of only a single destination.
