     It is possible for the EAP peer and EAP server to mutually
     authenticate and derive a AAA-Key for a ciphersuite used to protect
     subsequent data traffic.  This does not present an issue on the peer,
     since the peer and EAP client reside on the same machine; all that is
     required is for the client to derive the AAA-Key from the MSK and
     EMSK exported by the EAP method, and to subsequently pass a Transient
     Session Key (TSK) to the ciphersuite module.
