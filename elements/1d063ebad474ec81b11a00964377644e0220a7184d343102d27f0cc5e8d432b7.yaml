        The intra-domain routing protocols allow for information
        abstraction to be maintained within a domain.  For zero-homed and
        single-homed routing domains (which are expected to remain zero-
        homed or single-homed), we recommend that the IP addresses
        assigned within a single routing domain use a single address
        prefix assigned to that domain.  Specifically, this allows the set
        of all IP addresses reachable within a single domain to be fully
        described via a single prefix.
