     In order to support supernetting efficiently, it is clear that some
     changes will need to be made to both routing protocols themselves and
     to the way in which routing information is interpreted. In the case
     of "new" inter-domain protocols, the actual protocol syntax changes
     should be relatively minor. This mechanism will not work with older
     inter-domain protocols such as EGP2; the only ways to interoperate
     with old systems using such protocols are either to use existing
     mechanisms for providing "default" routes or b) require that new
     routers talking to old routers "explode" supernet information into
     individual network numbers.  Since the first of these is trivial
     while the latter is cumbersome (at best -- consider the memory
     requirements it imposes on the receiver of the exploded information),
     it is recommended that the first approach be used -- that older
     systems to continue to the mechanisms they currently employ for
     default handling.
