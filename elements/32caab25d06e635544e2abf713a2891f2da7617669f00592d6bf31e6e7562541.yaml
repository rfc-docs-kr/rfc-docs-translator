     Note that as described in Section 3.2, once a non-null cipher suite
     has been activated, the effective maximum fragment length depends on
     the cipher suite and compression method, as well as on the negotiated
     max_fragment_length.  This must be taken into account when sizing
     buffers, and checking for buffer overflow.

  섹션 3.2에 설명된 대로 null이 아닌 암호화 모음이 활성화되면 효과적인 최대 조각 길이는 협상된 max_fragment_length뿐만 아니라 암호화 모음 및 압축 방법에 따라 달라집니다. 버퍼 크기를 조정하고 버퍼 오버플로를 확인할 때 이 점을 고려해야 합니다.
