          routers attached to the network.  A router, having Designated
          Router potential, sends Hello Packets to all other potential
          Designated Routers when its interface to the NBMA network first
          becomes operational.  This is an attempt to find the Designated
          Router for the network.  If the router itself is elected
          Designated Router, it begins sending Hello Packets to all other
          routers attached to the network.
