     In both IPsec-based mechanisms, it is expected that appropriate
     policy entries for protecting SIP have been configured or will be
     created before attempting to use the security agreement procedure,
     and that SIP communications use port numbers and addresses according
     to these policy entries.  It is outside the scope of this
     specification to describe how this information can be made known to
     the peers, but it would typically be configured at the same time as
     the IKE credentials or manual SAs have been entered.

  두 IPsec 기반 메커니즘 모두에서 SIP를 보호하기 위한 적절한 정책 항목이 구성되었거나 보안 계약 절차를 사용하기 전에 생성될 것으로 예상되며, SIP 통신은 이러한 정책 항목에 따라 포트 번호와 주소를 사용합니다. 이 정보를 피어에게 알리는 방법을 설명하는 것은 이 사양의 범위를 벗어나지만, 일반적으로 IKE 자격 증명 또는 수동 SA가 입력되는 동시에 구성됩니다.
