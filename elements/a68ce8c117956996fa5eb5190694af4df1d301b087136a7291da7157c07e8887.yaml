          The Designated Router election algorithm proceeds as follows:
          Call the router doing the calculation Router X.  The list of
          neighbors attached to the network and having established
          bidirectional communication with Router X is examined.  This
          list is precisely the collection of Router X's neighbors (on
          this network) whose state is greater than or equal to 2-Way (see
          Section 10.1).  Router X itself is also considered to be on the
          list.  Discard all routers from the list that are ineligible to
          become Designated Router.  (Routers having Router Priority of 0
          are ineligible to become Designated Router.)  The following
          steps are then executed, considering only those routers that
          remain on the list:
