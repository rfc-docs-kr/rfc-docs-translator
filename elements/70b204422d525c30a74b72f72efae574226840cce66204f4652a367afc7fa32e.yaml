     translated to MTP-TRANSFER request primitives, and sent to the local
     M3UA-resident message distribution function for ongoing routing to
     the final IP destination.  Messages received from the local M3UA
     network address translation and mapping function as MTP-TRANSFER
     indication primitives are sent to the MTP Level 3 upper-layer
     interface as MTP-TRANSFER request primitives for ongoing MTP Level 3
     routing to an SS7 SEP.  For the purposes of providing SS7 network
     status information, the NIF also delivers MTP-PAUSE, MTP-RESUME, and
     MTP-STATUS indication primitives received from the MTP Level 3
     upper-layer interface to the local M3UA-resident management function.
     In addition, as an implementation and network option, restricted
     destinations are communicated from MTP network management to the
     local M3UA-resident management function.
