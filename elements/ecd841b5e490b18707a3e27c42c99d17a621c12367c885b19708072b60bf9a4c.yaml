     In Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), memory constraints on routers
     may limit them to maintaining, at most, a few routes.  In some
     configurations, it is necessary to use these memory-constrained
     routers to deliver datagrams to nodes within the LLN.  The Routing
     Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) can be used in some
     deployments to store most, if not all, routes on one (e.g., the
     Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) root) or a few routers and forward the
     IPv6 datagram using a source routing technique to avoid large routing
     tables on memory-constrained routers.  This document specifies a new
     IPv6 Routing header type for delivering datagrams within a RPL
     routing domain.
