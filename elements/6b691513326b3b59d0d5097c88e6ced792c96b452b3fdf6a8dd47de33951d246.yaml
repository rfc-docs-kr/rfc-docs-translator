     When the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP included in the answer message has a
     non-zero value, a route entry for the redirect indications is created
     and cached by the receiver.  The redirect usage for such a route
     entry is set by the value of Redirect-Host-Usage AVP and the lifetime
     of the cached route entry is set by Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVP
     value.
