        This Standards Track RFC discussed routing and address aggregation
        considerations at some length.  Some of these issues are
        summarized in this document in section Section 3.1.  Because
        address assignment policies and procedures now reside mainly with
        the RIRs, it is not appropriate to try to document those practices
        in a Standards Track RFC.  In addition, [RFC3221] also describes
        many of the same issues from point of view of the routing system.
