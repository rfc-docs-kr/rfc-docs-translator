     An ASP MAY request modification of an existing Routing Key by
     including a Routing Context parameter in a Registration Request
     message.  Upon receipt of a Registration Request message containing a
     Routing Context, if the SGP determines that the Routing Context
     applies to an existing Routing Key, the SGP MAY adjust the existing
     Routing Key to match the new information provided in the Routing Key
     parameter.  A Registration Response "ERR Routing Key Change Refused"
     is returned if the SGP does not support this re-registration
     procedure or RC does not exist.  Otherwise, a Registration Response
     "Successfully Registered" is returned.
