      [19]By keeping more information in the routing table, it is possible
      for an implementation to recalculate the shortest path tree for only
      a single area.  In fact, there are incremental algorithms that allow
      an implementation to recalculate only a portion of a single area's
      shortest path tree [Ref1].  However, these algorithms are beyond the
      scope of this specification.
