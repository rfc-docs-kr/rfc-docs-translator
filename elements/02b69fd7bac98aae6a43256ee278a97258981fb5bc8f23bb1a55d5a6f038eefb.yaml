     The DELETE method requests that the origin server remove the
     association between the target resource and its current
     functionality.  In effect, this method is similar to the "rm" command
     in UNIX: it expresses a deletion operation on the URI mapping of the
     origin server rather than an expectation that the previously
     associated information be deleted.

  DELETE 메소드는 원본 서버가 대상 리소스와 현재 기능 간의 연결을 제거하도록 요청합니다. 실제로 이 방법은 UNIX의 "rm" 명령과 유사합니다. 즉, 이전에 연관된 정보가 삭제된다는 기대보다는 원본 서버의 URI 매핑에 대한 삭제 작업을 표현합니다.
