            One side effect of migrating mapping state is that a server
            deployed behind an AFTR does not need to update its DNS
            records (if any) by means of dynamic DNS, for example.  If a
            dedicated mapping is instantiated, migrating the state during
            its validity lifetime will ensure that the same external IP
            address and port are assigned to that server.
