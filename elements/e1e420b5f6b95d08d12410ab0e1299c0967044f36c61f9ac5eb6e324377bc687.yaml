        Direct providers may give part of their address space (prefixes)
        to leaf domains, based on an address prefix given to the provider.
        This results in direct providers advertising to backbones a small
        fraction of the number of address prefixes that would be necessary
        if they enumerated the individual prefixes of the leaf routing
        domains.  This represents a significant savings given the expected
        scale of global internetworking.
