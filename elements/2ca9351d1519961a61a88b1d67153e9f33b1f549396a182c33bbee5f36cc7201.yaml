         DESCRIPTION
                "A reference to MIB definitions specific to the
                 particular routing protocol that is responsible for
                 this route, as determined by the value specified in the
                 route's ipForwardProto value.  If this information is
                 not present, its value should be set to the OBJECT
                 IDENTIFIER { 0 0 }, which is a syntactically valid
                 object identifier, and any implementation conforming to
                 ASN.1 and the Basic Encoding Rules must be able to
                 generate and recognize this value."
