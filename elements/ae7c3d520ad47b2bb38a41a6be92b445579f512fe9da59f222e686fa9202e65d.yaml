     Changes to ICMP error message will include changes to the original IP
     packet (or portions thereof) embedded in the payload of the ICMP
     error message. In order for NAT to be completely transparent to end
     hosts, the IP address of the IP header embedded in the payload of the
     ICMP packet must be modified, the checksum field of the same IP
     header must correspondingly be modified, and the accompanying
     transport header. The ICMP header checksum must also be modified to
     reflect changes made to the IP and transport headers in the payload.
     Furthermore, the normal IP header must also be modified.
