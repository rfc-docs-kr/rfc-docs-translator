     Since private IPv4 addresses assigned to hosts serviced by a B4
     element overlap across multiple CPEs, the IPv6 address of a B4
     element plays a key role in demultiplexing connections, enforcing
     policies, and in identifying associated resources assigned for each
     of the connections maintained by the Address Family Transition Router
     (AFTR) [RFC6333].  For example, these resources maintain state of
     Endpoint-Independent Mapping (EIM) as defined in Section 4.1 of
     [RFC4787], Endpoint-Independent Filtering (EIF) as defined in
     Section 5 of [RFC4787], preserve the external IPv4 address assigned
     in the AFTR (i.e., "IP address pooling" behavior as defined in
     Section 4.1 of [RFC4787]), PCP mappings, etc.

  B4 요소에 의해 서비스되는 호스트에 할당된 개인 IPv4 주소는 여러 CPE에 걸쳐 중복되므로 B4 요소의 IPv6 주소는 연결을 다중화하고 정책을 시행하며 주소에 의해 유지되는 각 연결에 할당된 관련 리소스를 식별하는 데 핵심적인 역할을 합니다. AFTR(패밀리 전환 라우터) [RFC6333].  예를 들어, 이러한 리소스는 [RFC4787] 섹션 4.1에 정의된 EIM(Endpoint-Independent Mapping) 상태, [RFC4787] 섹션 5에 정의된 EIF(Endpoint-Independent Filtering) 상태를 유지하고, AFTR(즉, [RFC4787]의 섹션 4.1에 정의된 "IP 주소 풀링" 동작), PCP 매핑 등
