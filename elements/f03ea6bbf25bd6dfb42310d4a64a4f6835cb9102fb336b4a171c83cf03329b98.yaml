     Simulators and emulators should be able to capture faithfully all
     features and operations of the respective ICN architecture(s) and any
     limitations should be openly documented.  It is essential that these
     tools and environments come with adequate logging facilities so that
     one can use them for in-depth analysis as well as debugging.
     Additional requirements include the ability to support medium- to
     large-scale experiments, the ability to quickly and correctly set
     various configurations and parameters, as well as to support the
     playback of traffic traces captured on a real testbed or network.
     Obviously, this does not even begin to touch upon the need for strong
     validation of any evaluated implementations.
