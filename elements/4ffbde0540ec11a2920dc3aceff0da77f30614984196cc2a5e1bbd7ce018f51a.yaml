                   In an implementation with a segment retransmission
                   queue, TCP performance may be enhanced by repacketizing
                   the segments awaiting acknowledgment when the first
                   retransmission timeout occurs.  That is, the
                   outstanding segments that fitted would be combined into
                   one maximum-sized segment, with a new IP Identification
                   value.  The TCP would then retain this combined segment
                   in the retransmit queue until it was acknowledged.
                   However, if the first two segments in the
                   retransmission queue totalled more than one maximum-
                   sized segment, the TCP would retransmit only the first
                   segment using the original IP Identification field.
