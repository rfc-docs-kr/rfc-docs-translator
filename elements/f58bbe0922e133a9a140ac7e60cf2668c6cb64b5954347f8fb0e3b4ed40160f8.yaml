     Rule #1 guarantees that the forwarding algorithm used is consistent
     across routing protocols and implementations.  Multi-homed networks
     are always explicitly advertised by every service provider through
     which they are routed, even if they are a specific subset of one
     service provider's aggregate (if they are not, they clearly must be
     explicitly advertised).  It may seem as if the "primary" service
     provider could advertise the multi-homed site implicitly as part of
     its aggregate, but longest-match forwarding causes this not to work.
     More details are provided in [RFC4116].
