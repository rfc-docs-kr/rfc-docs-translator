        The RIF information should be kept distinct from the ARP table.
        That is, there is, in principle, the ARP table to map from IP
        addresses to 802 48-bit addresses, and the RIF table to map from
        those to 802.5 source routes, if necessary.  In practical
        implementations it may be convenient to store the ARP and RIF
        information together.
