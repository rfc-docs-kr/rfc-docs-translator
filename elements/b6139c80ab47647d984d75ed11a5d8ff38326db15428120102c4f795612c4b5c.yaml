              In the second case, the parent vertex is a network that
              directly connects the calculating router to the destination
              router.  The list of next hops is then determined by
              examining the destination's router-LSA.  For each link in
              the router-LSA that points back to the parent network, the
              link's Link Data field provides the IP address of a next hop
              router.  The outgoing interface to use can then be derived
              from the next hop IP address (or it can be inherited from
              the parent network).
