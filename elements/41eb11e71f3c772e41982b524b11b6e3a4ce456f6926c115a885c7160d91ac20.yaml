     For each TCP-capable media stream the agent wishes to use (including
     ones like RTP that can be either UDP or TCP), the agent SHOULD obtain
     two host candidates (each on a different port) for each component of
     the media stream on each interface that the host has -- one for the
     simultaneous-open and one for the passive candidate.  If an agent is
     not capable of acting in one of these modes, it would omit those
     candidates.
