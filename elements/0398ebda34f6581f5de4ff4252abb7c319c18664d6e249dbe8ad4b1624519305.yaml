     When using IPv6-in-IPv6 tunneling, in order to respect the IPv6 Hop
     Limit value of the original datagram, a RPL router generating an SRH
     MUST set the Segments Left to less than the original datagram's IPv6
     Hop Limit value upon forwarding.  In the case that the source route
     is longer than the original datagram's IPv6 Hop Limit, only the
     initial hops (determined by the original datagram's IPv6 Hop Limit)
     should be included in the SRH.  If the RPL router is not the source
     of the original datagram, the original datagram's IPv6 Hop Limit
     field is decremented before generating the SRH.  After generating the
     SRH, the RPL router decrements the original datagram's IPv6 Hop Limit
     value by the SRH Segments Left value.  Processing the SRH Segments
