        The Address format is derived from the OctetString Basic AVP
        Format.  It is a discriminated union representing, for example, a
        32-bit (IPv4) [RFC0791] or 128-bit (IPv6) [RFC4291] address, most
        significant octet first.  The first two octets of the Address AVP
        represent the AddressType, which contains an Address Family,
        defined in [IANAADFAM].  The AddressType is used to discriminate
        the content and format of the remaining octets.
