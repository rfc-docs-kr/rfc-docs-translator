     As [RFC-2228] allows security qualities to be negotiated, enabled,
     and disabled dynamically, this can make implementations seem quite
     complex.  However, in any given instance the behaviour should be
     quite straightforward.  Either the server will be enforcing the
     policy of the server host or it will be providing security
     capabilities requested by the client.  Either the client will be
     conforming to the server's policy or will be endeavouring to provide
     the capabilities that the user desires.
