     This specification will do little for the Denial of Service element
     of this section; however, strong authentication on the data
     connection will prevent unauthorised connections from retrieving or
     submitting files.  Of course, this is only the case where strong
     client authentication is being used.  If client certificates are not
     used, then port stealing by a rogue client is still a problem.  If no
     strong authentication is in use at all (e.g., anonymous Diffie-
     Hellman), then the port stealing problem will remain.
