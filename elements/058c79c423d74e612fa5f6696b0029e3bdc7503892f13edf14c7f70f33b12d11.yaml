     This MIB provides for direct reporting and manipulation of detailed
     functional elements.  These elements consist of a structural element
     and one or more parameter-bearing elements.  While this can be
     cumbersome, it allows the reuse of parameters.  For example, a
     service provider may offer three varieties of contracts, and
     configure three parameter elements.  Each such data path on the
     system may then refer to these sets of parameters.  The
     diffServDataPathTable couples each direction on each interface with
     the specified data path linkage.  The concept of "interface" is as
     defined by InterfaceIndex/ifIndex of the IETF Interfaces MIB [IF-
     MIB].
