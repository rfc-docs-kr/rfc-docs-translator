                   Suppose the total receive buffer space is RCV.BUFF.  At
                   any given moment, RCV.USER octets of this total may be
                   tied up with data that has been received and
                   acknowledged but which the user process has not yet
                   consumed.  When the connection is quiescent, RCV.WND =
                   RCV.BUFF and RCV.USER = 0.
