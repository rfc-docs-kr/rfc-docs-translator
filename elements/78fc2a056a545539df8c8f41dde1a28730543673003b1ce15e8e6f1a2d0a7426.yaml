     Within EAP-TLS [RFC2716], a MIC validation failure is treated as a
     fatal error, since that is what is specified in TLS [RFC2246].
     However, it is also possible to develop EAP methods that support
     per-packet MICs, and respond to verification failures by silently
     discarding the offending packet.
