     One aspect of Internet services that was notably affected by the move
     to CIDR was the mechanism used for address-to-name translation:  the
     IN-ADDR.ARPA zone of the domain system.  Because this zone is
     delegated on octet boundaries only, the move to an address assignment
     plan that uses bitmask-oriented addressing caused some increase in
     work for those who maintain parts of the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.
