         the most modern routing equipment made in 2005.  What is
         different is that the moderate complexity of correctly
         configuring routers in the presence of CIDR tends to make
         accidental "attacks" of this sort more likely.  Measures to
         prevent this sort of attack are much the same as those described
         above for the hijacking, with the addition that best common
         practice is also to configure a reasonable maximum number of
         prefixes that a border router will accept from its neighbors.
