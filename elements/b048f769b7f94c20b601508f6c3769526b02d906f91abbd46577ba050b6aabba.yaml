     A recent article [Delignat14] describes a security issue whereby
     SSLv3 fallback and improper handling of session caches on the server
     side can be abused by an attacker to establish a malicious connection
     to a virtual host other than the one originally intended and approved
     by the server.  This attack is especially serious in performance
     critical environments where sharing of SSLv3 session caches is very
     common.
