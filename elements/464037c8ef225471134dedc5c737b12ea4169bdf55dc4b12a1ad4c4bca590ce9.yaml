     To deliver an IPv6 datagram to its destination, a router may need to
     generate a new SRH and specify a strict source route.  When the
     router is the source of the original packet and the destination is
     known to be within the same RPL routing domain, the router SHOULD
     include the SRH directly within the original packet.  Otherwise, the
     router MUST use IPv6-in-IPv6 tunneling [RFC2473] and place the SRH in
     the tunnel header.  Using IPv6-in-IPv6 tunneling ensures that the
     delivered datagram remains unmodified and that ICMPv6 errors
     generated by an SRH are sent back to the router that generated the
     SRH.
