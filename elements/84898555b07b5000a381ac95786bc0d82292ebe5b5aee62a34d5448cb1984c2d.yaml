        An implementation that supports the Expanded attribute MUST treat
        EAP Types that are less than 256 equivalently, whether they appear
        as a single octet or as the 32-bit Vendor-Type within an Expanded
        Type where Vendor-Id is 0.  Peers not equipped to interpret the
        Expanded Type MUST send a Nak as described in Section 5.3.1, and
        negotiate a more suitable authentication method.
