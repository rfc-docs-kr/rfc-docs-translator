     Because private addresses have no global meaning, routing information
     about private networks shall not be propagated on inter-enterprise
     links, and packets with private source or destination addresses
     should not be forwarded across such links.  Routers in networks not
     using private address space, especially those of Internet service
     providers, are expected to be configured to reject (filter out)
     routing information about private networks.  If such a router
     receives such information the rejection shall not be treated as a
     routing protocol error.
