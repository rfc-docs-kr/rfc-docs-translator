                   At present, pinging (i.e., using ICMP Echo messages) is
                   the mechanism for gateway probing when absolutely
                   required.  A successful ping guarantees that the
                   addressed interface and its associated machine are up,
                   but it does not guarantee that the machine is a gateway
                   as opposed to a host.  The normal inference is that if
                   a Redirect or other evidence indicates that a machine
                   was a gateway, successful pings will indicate that the
                   machine is still up and hence still a gateway.
                   However, since a host silently discards packets that a
                   gateway would forward or redirect, this assumption
                   could sometimes fail.  To avoid this problem, a new
                   ICMP message under development will ask "are you a
                   gateway?"
