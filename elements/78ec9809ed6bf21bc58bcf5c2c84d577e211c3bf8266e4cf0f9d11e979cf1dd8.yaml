          An area can be configured as a stub when there is a single exit
          point from the area, or when the choice of exit point need not
          be made on a per-external-destination basis.  For example, Area
          3 in Figure 6 could be configured as a stub area, because all
          external traffic must travel though its single area border
          router RT11.  If Area 3 were configured as a stub, Router RT11
          would advertise a default route for distribution inside Area 3
          (in a summary-LSA), instead of flooding the AS-external-LSAs for
          Networks N12-N15 into/throughout the area.
