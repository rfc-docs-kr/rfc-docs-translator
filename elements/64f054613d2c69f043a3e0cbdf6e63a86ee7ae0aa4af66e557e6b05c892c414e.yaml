     Commands may be marked as "Optional" which can override this
     behaviour -  if a command marked as Optional results in an error,
     subsequent commands in the Transaction will be executed.  If a
     command fails, the MG shall as far as possible restore the state that
     existed prior to the attempted execution of the command before
     continuing with command processing.
