                      A forwarding address can also be specified for the
                      default route.  For example, in figure 16 RTA may
                      want to specify that all externally-destined packets
                      should by default be forwarded to its BGP peer RTX.
                      The resulting AS-external-LSA is pictured below.
                      Note that the Link State ID is set to
                      DefaultDestination.
