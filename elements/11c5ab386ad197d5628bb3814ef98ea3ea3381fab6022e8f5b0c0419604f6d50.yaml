     If the transport receiver does not authenticate the transport sender,
     it may accept data from an attacker.  Unless it has another way of
     authenticating the source of the data, the data should not be
     trusted.  This is especially important if the syslog data is going to
     be used to detect and react to security incidents.  The transport
     receiver may also increase its vulnerability to denial of service,
     resource consumption, and other attacks if it does not authenticate
     the transport sender.  Because of the increased vulnerability to
     attack, this type of configuration is NOT RECOMMENDED.
