     A NETCONF session is the logical connection between a network
     administrator or network configuration application and a network
     device.  A device MUST support at least one NETCONF session and
     SHOULD support multiple sessions.  Global configuration attributes
     can be changed during any authorized session, and the effects are
     visible in all sessions.  Session-specific attributes affect only the
     session in which they are changed.
