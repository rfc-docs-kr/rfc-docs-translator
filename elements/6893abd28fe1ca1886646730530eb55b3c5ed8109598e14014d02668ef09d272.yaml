           Protocol layering, which is generally used as an organizing
           principle in implementing network software, has also been used
           to organize this document.  In describing the rules, we assume
           that an implementation does strictly mirror the layering of the
           protocols.  Thus, the following three major sections specify
           the requirements for the link layer, the internet layer, and
           the transport layer, respectively.  A companion RFC [INTRO:1]
           covers application level software.  This layerist organization
           was chosen for simplicity and clarity.
