     The higher level concept of a TCB is not required in the
     parameterization or in the linking together of the individual
     elements, hence it is not used in the MIB itself and is only
     mentioned in the text for relating the MIB with the [MODEL].  Rather,
     the MIB models the individual elements that make up the TCBs.
