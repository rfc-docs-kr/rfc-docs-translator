        The Urgent Pointer was used because, in a Unix implementation, the
        receipt of a TCP packet marked as Urgent would result in the
        execution of the SIGURG interrupt handler.  This reliance on
        interrupt handlers was necessary on systems that did not implement
        select() or did not support multiple threads.  TLS does not
        support the notion of Urgent data.
