     | Mux              | Describes multiplex type for multimedia       |
     |                  | terminations (e.g. H.221, H.223, H.225.0)     |
     |                  | and Terminations forming the input mux.       |
     | Media            | A list of media stream specifications         |
     |                  | (see 7.1.4).                                  |
     | TerminationState | Properties of a Termination (which can be     |
     |                  | defined in Packages) that are not stream      |
     |                  | specific.                                     |
     | Stream           | A list of remote/local/localControl           |
     |                  | descriptors for a single stream.              |
     | Local            | Contains properties that specify the media    |
     |                  | flows that the MG receives from the remote    |
     |                  | entity.                                       |
     | Remote           | Contains properties that specify the media    |
     |                  | flows that the MG sends to the remote entity. |
     | LocalControl     | Contains properties (which can be defined in  |
     |                  | packages) that are of interest between the MG |
     |                  | and the MGC.                                  |
     | Events           | Describes events to be detected by the MG and |
     |                  | what to do when an event is detected.         |
     | EventBuffer      | Describes events to be detected by the MG     |
     |                  | when Event Buffering is active.               |
     | Signals          | Describes signals and/or actions to be        |
     |                  | applied (e.g. Busy Tone) to the Terminations. |
     | Audit            | In Audit commands, identifies which           |
     |                  | information is desired.                       |
     | Packages         | In AuditValue, returns a list of Packages     |
     |                  | realized by Termination.                      |
     | DigitMap         | Defines patterns against which sequences of a |
     |                  | specified set of events are to be matched so  |
     |                  | they can be reported as a group rather than   |
     |                  | singly.                                       |
     | ServiceChange    | In ServiceChange, what, why service change    |
