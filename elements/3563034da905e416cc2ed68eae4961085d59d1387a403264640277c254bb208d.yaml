     Delegated credentials are only used in (D)TLS 1.3 connections.
     However, the certificate that signs a delegated credential may be
     used in other contexts such as (D)TLS 1.2.  Using a certificate in
     multiple contexts opens up a potential cross-protocol attack against
     delegated credentials in (D)TLS 1.3.
