     NAT devices attempt to provide a transparent routing solution to end
     hosts trying to communicate from disparate address realms. This is
     achieved by modifying end node addresses en-route and maintaining
     state for these updates so that datagrams pertaining to a session are
     routed to the right end-node in either realm. This solution only
     works when the applications do not use the IP addresses as part of
     the protocol itself. For example, identifying endpoints using DNS
     names rather than addresses makes applications less dependent of the
     actual addresses that NAT chooses and avoids the need to also
     translate payload contents when NAT changes an IP address.
