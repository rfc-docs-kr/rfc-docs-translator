     The copy of the responses may be destroyed either LONG-TIMER seconds
     after the response is issued, or when the entity receives a
     confirmation that the response has been received, through the
     "Response Acknowledgement parameter". For transactions that are
     acknowledged through this parameter, the entity shall keep a copy of
     the transaction-id for LONG-TIMER seconds after the response is
     issued, in order to detect and ignore duplicate copies of the
     transaction request that could be produced by the network.
