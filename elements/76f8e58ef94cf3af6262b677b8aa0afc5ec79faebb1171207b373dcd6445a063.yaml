           DISCUSSION:
                IGMP provides gateways that are capable of multicast
                routing with the information required to support IP
                multicasting across multiple networks.  At this time,
                multicast-routing gateways are in the experimental stage
                and are not widely available.  For hosts that are not
                connected to networks with multicast-routing gateways or
                that do not need to receive multicast datagrams
                originating on other networks, IGMP serves no purpose and
                is therefore optional for now.  However, the rest of
                [IP:4] is currently recommended for the purpose of
                providing IP-layer access to local network multicast
                addressing, as a preferable alternative to local broadcast
                addressing.  It is expected that IGMP will become
                recommended at some future date, when multicast-routing
                gateways have become more widely available.
