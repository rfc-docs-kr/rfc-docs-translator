              All IP options (except NOP or END-OF-LIST) received in
              datagrams MUST be passed to the transport layer (or to ICMP
              processing when the datagram is an ICMP message).  The IP
              and transport layer MUST each interpret those IP options
              that they understand and silently ignore the others.
