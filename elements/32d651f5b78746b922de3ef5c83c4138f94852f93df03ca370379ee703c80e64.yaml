        However, there is a difference when the provider distributes
        routing information to other providers (e.g., backbones or TRDs).
        In the first case, the provider cannot aggregate the site's
        address into its own prefix; the address must be explicitly listed
        in routing exchanges, resulting in an additional burden to other
        providers which must exchange and maintain this information.
