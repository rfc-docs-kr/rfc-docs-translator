          (4) If Router X is now newly the Designated Router or newly the
              Backup Designated Router, or is now no longer the Designated
              Router or no longer the Backup Designated Router, repeat
              steps 2 and 3, and then proceed to step 5.  For example, if
              Router X is now the Designated Router, when step 2 is
              repeated X will no longer be eligible for Backup Designated
              Router election.  Among other things, this will ensure that
              no router will declare itself both Backup Designated Router
              and Designated Router.[5]
