     The Diameter accounting server MAY override the interim interval or
     the real-time requirements by including the Acct-Interim-Interval or
     Accounting-Realtime-Required AVP in the Accounting-Answer message.
     When one of these AVPs is present, the latest value received SHOULD
     be used in further accounting activities for the same session.
