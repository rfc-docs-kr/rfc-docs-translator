     If an agent is securing non-RTP media over TCP/TLS, the SDP MUST be
     constructed as described in RFC 4572 [RFC4572].  The directionality
     attributes (a=setup) are utilized strictly to determine the direction
     of the TLS handshake.  Directionality of the TCP connection
     establishment is determined by the ICE attributes and procedures
     defined here.
