          (1) The LS age field of one of the router's self-originated LSAs
              reaches the value LSRefreshTime. In this case, a new
              instance of the LSA is originated, even though the contents
              of the LSA (apart from the LSA header) will be the same.
              This guarantees periodic originations of all LSAs.  This
              periodic updating of LSAs adds robustness to the link state
              algorithm.  LSAs that solely describe unreachable
              destinations should not be refreshed, but should instead be
              flushed from the routing domain (see Section 14.1).
