     There are four different authorization session state machines
     supported in the Diameter base protocol.  The first two describe a
     session in which the server is maintaining session state, indicated
     by the value of the Auth-Session-State AVP (or its absence).  One
     describes the session from a client perspective, the other from a
     server perspective.  The second two state machines are used when the
     server does not maintain session state.  Here again, one describes
     the session from a client perspective, the other from a server
     perspective.
