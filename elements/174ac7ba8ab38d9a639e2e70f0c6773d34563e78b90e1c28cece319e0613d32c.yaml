     For the purposes of this paper, an IP prefix is an IP address and
     some indication of the leftmost contiguous significant bits within
     this address. Throughout this paper IP address prefixes will be
     expressed as <IP-address IP-mask> tuples, such that a bitwise logical
     AND operation on the IP-address and IP-mask components of a tuple
     yields the sequence of leftmost contiguous significant bits that form
     the IP address prefix. For example a tuple with the value <193.1.0.0
     255.255.0.0> denotes an IP address prefix with 16 leftmost contiguous
     significant bits.
