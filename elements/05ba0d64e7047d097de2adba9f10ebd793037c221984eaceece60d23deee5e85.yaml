     For Q values 128-255, dynamically defined quantization tables are
     used.  These tables may be specified either in-band or out of band by
     something like a session setup protocol, but the Quantization Table
     header MUST be present in the first packet of every frame. When the
     tables are specified out of band, they may be omitted from the packet
     by setting the Length field in this header to 0.
