          Link state databases must remain synchronized over all
          adjacencies associated with the above eligible interfaces.  This
          is accomplished by executing the following steps on each
          eligible interface.  It should be noted that this procedure may
          decide not to flood an LSA out a particular interface, if there
          is a high probability that the attached neighbors have already
          received the LSA.  However, in these cases the flooding
          procedure must be absolutely sure that the neighbors eventually
          do receive the LSA, so the LSA is still added to each
          adjacency's Link state retransmission list.  For each eligible
          interface:
