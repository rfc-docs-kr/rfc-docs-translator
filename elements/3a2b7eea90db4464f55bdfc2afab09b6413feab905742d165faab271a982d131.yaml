     When multiple cached routes are created by redirect indications and
     they differ only in redirect usage and peers to forward requests to
     (see Section 6.1.8), a precedence rule MUST be applied to the
     redirect usage values of the cached routes during normal routing to
     resolve contentions that may occur.  The precedence rule is the order
     that dictate which redirect usage should be considered before any
     other as they appear.  The order is as follows:
"fixed": !!null |-
  null
"ko": !!null |-
  null
