                   The TOS field may also be mapped into link-layer
                   service selectors.  This has been applied to provide
                   effective sharing of serial lines by different classes
                   of TCP traffic, for example.  However, the mappings
                   suggested in RFC-795 for networks that were included in
                   the Internet as of 1981 are now obsolete.
