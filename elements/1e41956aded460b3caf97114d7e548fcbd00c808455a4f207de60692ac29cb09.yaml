     For the PSK ciphersuites, an attacker can get the information
     required for an off-line attack by eavesdropping on a TLS handshake,
     or by getting a valid client to attempt connection with the attacker
     (by tricking the client to connect to the wrong address, or by
     intercepting a connection attempt to the correct address, for
     instance).

  PSK 암호화 제품군의 경우 공격자는 TLS 핸드셰이크를 도청하거나 유효한 클라이언트가 공격자와 연결을 시도하도록 하여(클라이언트를 속여 잘못된 주소에 연결하거나, 예를 들어 올바른 주소에 대한 연결 시도를 가로채서).
