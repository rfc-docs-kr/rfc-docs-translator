          The format of an Hello packet is detailed in Section A.3.2.  The
          Hello Packet contains the router's Router Priority (used in
          choosing the Designated Router), and the interval between Hello
          Packets sent out the interface (HelloInterval).  The Hello
          Packet also indicates how often a neighbor must be heard from to
          remain active (RouterDeadInterval).  Both HelloInterval and
          RouterDeadInterval must be the same for all routers attached to
          a common network.  The Hello packet also contains the IP address
          mask of the attached network (Network Mask).  On unnumbered
          point-to-point networks and on virtual links this field should
          be set to 0.0.0.0.
