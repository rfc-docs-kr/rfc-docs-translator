     If a relay or proxy agent receives an answer with a Result-Code AVP
     indicating a failure, it MUST NOT modify the contents of the AVP.
     Any additional local errors detected SHOULD be logged but not
     reflected in the Result-Code AVP.  If the agent receives an answer
     message with a Result-Code AVP indicating success, and it wishes to
     modify the AVP to indicate an error, it MUST modify the Result-Code
     AVP to contain the appropriate error in the message destined towards
     the access device as well as include the Error-Reporting-Host AVP; it
     MUST also issue an STR on behalf of the access device towards the
     Diameter server.
