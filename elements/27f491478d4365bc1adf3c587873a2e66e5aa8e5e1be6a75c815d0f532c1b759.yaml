          However, if the received self-originated LSA is newer than the
          last instance that the router actually originated, the router
          must take special action.  The reception of such an LSA
          indicates that there are LSAs in the routing domain that were
          originated by the router before the last time it was restarted.
          In most cases, the router must then advance the LSA's LS
          sequence number one past the received LS sequence number, and
          originate a new instance of the LSA.
