     Once the handshake completes, if an endpoint is unable to buffer all
     data in a CRYPTO frame, it MAY discard that CRYPTO frame and all
     CRYPTO frames received in the future, or it MAY close the connection
     with a CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED error code.  Packets containing
     discarded CRYPTO frames MUST be acknowledged because the packet has
     been received and processed by the transport even though the CRYPTO
     frame was discarded.

  핸드셰이크가 완료되면 엔드포인트가 CRYPTO 프레임의 모든 데이터를 버퍼링할 수 없는 경우 해당 CRYPTO 프레임과 향후 수신되는 모든 CRYPTO 프레임을 삭제하거나 CRYPTO_BUFFER_EXCEEDED 오류 코드로 연결을 닫을 수 있습니다. 폐기된 CRYPTO 프레임을 포함하는 패킷은 CRYPTO 프레임이 폐기되었더라도 전송에 의해 패킷이 수신되고 처리되었기 때문에 반드시 승인되어야 합니다.
