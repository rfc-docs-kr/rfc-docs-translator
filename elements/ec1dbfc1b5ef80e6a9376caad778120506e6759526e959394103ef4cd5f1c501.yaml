     To support this message distribution, the SGP might, for example,
     maintain the equivalent of a network address translation table,
     mapping incoming SS7 message information to an Application Server for
     a particular application and range of traffic.  This could be
     accomplished by comparing elements of the incoming SS7 message to
     currently defined Routing Keys in the SGP.
