                  RT3 originates two router-LSAs, one for Area 1 and one
                  for the backbone.  Assume that Router RT4 has been
                  selected as the Designated router for network 192.1.1.0.
                  RT3's router-LSA for Area 1 is then shown below.  It
                  indicates that RT3 has two connections to Area 1, the
                  first a link to the transit network 192.1.1.0 and the
                  second a link to the stub network 192.1.4.0.  Note that
                  the transit network is identified by the IP interface of
                  its Designated Router (i.e., the Link ID = 192.1.1.4
                  which is the Designated Router RT4's IP interface to
                  192.1.1.0).  Note also that RT3 has indicated that it is
                  an area border router.
