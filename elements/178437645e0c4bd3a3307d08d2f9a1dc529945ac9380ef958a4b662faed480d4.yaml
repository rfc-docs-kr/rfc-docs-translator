                   Since the recommended algorithm is concerned with the
                   gateways pointed to by route cache entries, rather than
                   the cache entries themselves, a two level data
                   structure (perhaps coordinated with ARP or similar
                   caches) may be desirable for implementing a route
                   cache.
