     The Diameter server may assume that all sessions that were active
     prior to detection of a client restart have been terminated.  The
     Diameter server MAY clean up all session state associated with such
     lost sessions, and it MAY also issue STRs for all such lost sessions
     that were authorized on upstream servers, to allow session state to
     be cleaned up globally.
