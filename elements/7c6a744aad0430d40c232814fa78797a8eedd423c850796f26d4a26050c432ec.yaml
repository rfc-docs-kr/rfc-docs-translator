              In the Internet protocol architecture, a transport protocol
              instance ("entity") has no address of its own, but instead
              uses a single Internet Protocol (IP) address.  This has
              implications for the IP, transport, and application layers,
              and for the interfaces between them.  In particular, the
              application software may have to be aware of the multiple IP
              addresses of a multihomed host; in other cases, the choice
              can be made within the network software.
