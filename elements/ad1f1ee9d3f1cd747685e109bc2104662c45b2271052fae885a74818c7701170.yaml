     Unless the authenticator implements one or more authentication
     methods locally which support the authenticator role, the EAP method
     layer header fields (Type, Type-Data) are not examined as part of the
     forwarding decision.  Where the authenticator supports local
     authentication methods, it MAY examine the Type field to determine
     whether to act on the packet itself or forward it.  Compliant pass-
     through authenticator implementations MUST by default forward EAP
     packets of any Type.
