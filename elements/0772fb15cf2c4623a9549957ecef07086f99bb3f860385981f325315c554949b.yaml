     [d] EAP method layers.  EAP methods implement the authentication
         algorithms and receive and transmit EAP messages via the EAP peer
         and authenticator layers.  Since fragmentation support is not
         provided by EAP itself, this is the responsibility of EAP
         methods, which are discussed in Section 5.
