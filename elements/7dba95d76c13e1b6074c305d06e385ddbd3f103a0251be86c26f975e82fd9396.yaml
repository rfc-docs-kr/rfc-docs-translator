         In the randomDrop(4) algorithm, on packet arrival, an Active
         Queue Management algorithm is executed which may randomly drop a
         packet. This algorithm may be proprietary, and it may drop either
         the arriving packet or another packet in the queue.
         diffServAlgDropSpecific points to a diffServRandomDropEntry that
         describes the algorithm. For this algorithm,
