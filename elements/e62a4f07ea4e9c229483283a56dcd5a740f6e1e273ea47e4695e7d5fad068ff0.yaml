     When run over a reliable lower layer (e.g., EAP over ISAKMP/TCP, as
     within [PIC]), the authenticator retransmission timer SHOULD be set
     to an infinite value, so that retransmissions do not occur at the EAP
     layer.  The peer may still maintain a timeout value so as to avoid
     waiting indefinitely for a Request.
