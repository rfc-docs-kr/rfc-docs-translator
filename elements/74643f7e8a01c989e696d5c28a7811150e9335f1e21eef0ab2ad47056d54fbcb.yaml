          Sending delayed acknowledgments accomplishes several things: 1)
          it facilitates the packaging of multiple acknowledgments in a
          single Link State Acknowledgment packet, 2) it enables a single
          Link State Acknowledgment packet to indicate acknowledgments to
          several neighbors at once (through multicasting) and 3) it
          randomizes the Link State Acknowledgment packets sent by the
          various routers attached to a common network.  The fixed
          interval between a router's delayed transmissions must be short
          (less than RxmtInterval) or needless retransmissions will ensue.
