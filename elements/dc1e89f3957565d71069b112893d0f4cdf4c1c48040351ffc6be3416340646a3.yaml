      In each endpoint router, the cost and viability of the virtual link
      is discovered by examining the routing table entry for the other
      endpoint router.  (The entry's associated area must be the
      configured Transit area).  This is called the virtual link's
      corresponding routing table entry.  The InterfaceUp event occurs for
      a virtual link when its corresponding routing table entry becomes
      reachable.  Conversely, the InterfaceDown event occurs when its
      routing table entry becomes unreachable.  In other words, the
      virtual link's viability is determined by the existence of an
      intra-area path, through the Transit area, between the two
      endpoints.  Note that a virtual link whose underlying path has cost
      greater than hexadecimal 0xffff (the maximum size of an interface
      cost in a router-LSA) should be considered inoperational (i.e.,
      treated the same as if the path did not exist).
