     Cryptographic binding
        The demonstration of the EAP peer to the EAP server that a single
        entity has acted as the EAP peer for all methods executed within a
        tunnel method.  Binding MAY also imply that the EAP server
        demonstrates to the peer that a single entity has acted as the EAP
        server for all methods executed within a tunnel method.  If
        executed correctly, binding serves to mitigate man-in-the-middle
        vulnerabilities.
