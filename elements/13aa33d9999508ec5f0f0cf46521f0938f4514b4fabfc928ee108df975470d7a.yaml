                  (c) The calculated and received digests are compared. If
                      they do not match, the OSPF packet is discarded. If
                      they do match, the OSPF protocol packet is accepted
                      as authentic, and the "cryptographic sequence
                      number" in the neighbor's data structure is set to
                      the sequence number found in the packet's OSPF
                      header.
