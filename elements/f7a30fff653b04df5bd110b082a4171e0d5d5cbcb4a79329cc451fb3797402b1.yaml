          There are many possible ways of dividing up a class A, B, and C
          network into variable sized subnets.  The precise procedure for
          doing so is beyond the scope of this specification.  This
          specification however establishes the following guideline: When
          an IP packet is forwarded, it is always forwarded to the network
          that is the best match for the packet's destination.  Here best
          match is synonymous with the longest or most specific match.
          For example, the default route with destination of 0.0.0.0 and
          mask 0x00000000 is always a match for every IP destination.  Yet
          it is always less specific than any other match.  Subnet masks
          must be assigned so that the best match for any IP destination
          is unambiguous.
