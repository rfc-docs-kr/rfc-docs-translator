           o  Note that for the TIME-WAIT state, there is an improved
              algorithm described in [40] for handling incoming SYN
              segments that utilizes timestamps rather than relying on the
              sequence number check described here.  When the improved
              algorithm is implemented, the logic above is not applicable
              for incoming SYN segments with Timestamp Options, received
              on a connection in the TIME-WAIT state.
