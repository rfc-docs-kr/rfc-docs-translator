          One can picture the collection of adjacencies on a network as
          forming an undirected graph.  The vertices consist of routers,
          with an edge joining two routers if they are adjacent.  The
          graph of adjacencies describes the flow of routing protocol
          packets, and in particular Link State Update Packets, through
          the Autonomous System.
