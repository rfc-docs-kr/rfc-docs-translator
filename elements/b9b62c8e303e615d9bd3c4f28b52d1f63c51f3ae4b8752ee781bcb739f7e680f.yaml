           DISCUSSION:
                The IEEE 802.3 specification provides for operation over a
                10Mbps Ethernet cable, in which case Ethernet and IEEE
                802.3 frames can be physically intermixed.  A receiver can
                distinguish Ethernet and 802.3 frames by the value of the
                802.3 Length field; this two-octet field coincides in the
                header with the Ether-Type field of an Ethernet frame.  In
                particular, the 802.3 Length field must be less than or
                equal to 1500, while all valid Ether-Type values are
                greater than 1500.
