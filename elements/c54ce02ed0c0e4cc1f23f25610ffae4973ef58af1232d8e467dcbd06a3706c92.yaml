     In practice, prefixes of length shorter than 8 have not been
     allocated or assigned to date, although routes to such short prefixes
     may exist in routing tables if or when aggressive aggregation is
     performed.  As of the writing of this document, no such routes are
     seen in the global routing system, but operator error and other
     events have caused some of them (i.e., 128.0.0.0/1 and 192.0.0.0/2)
     to be observed in some networks at some times in the past.
