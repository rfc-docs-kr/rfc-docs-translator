     Because an Internet Fax is sent as a MIME e-mail message to the
     offramp gateway, digital signatures can be used to authenticate and
     authorize the user.  S/MIME is one example of a protocol that
     includes digital signature services.  S/MIME is described in
     [9][10][11][12][13].  Other methods of adding a digital signature to
     a mail message (such as OpenPGP [17] [25]) MAY also be used to
     authenticate and authorize the user.
