     A transport sender MUST close the associated TLS connection if the
     connection is not expected to deliver any syslog messages later.  It
     MUST send a TLS close_notify alert before closing the connection.  A
     transport sender (TLS client) MAY choose to not wait for the
     transport receiver's close_notify alert and simply close the
     connection, thus generating an incomplete close on the transport
     receiver (TLS server) side.  Once the transport receiver gets a
     close_notify from the transport sender, it MUST reply with a
     close_notify unless it becomes aware that the connection has already
     been closed by the transport sender (e.g., the closure was indicated
     by TCP).
