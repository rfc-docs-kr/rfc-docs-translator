      The OSPF Options field is present in OSPF Hello packets, Database
      Description packets and all LSAs.  The Options field enables OSPF
      routers to support (or not support) optional capabilities, and to
      communicate their capability level to other OSPF routers.  Through
      this mechanism routers of differing capabilities can be mixed within
      an OSPF routing domain.
