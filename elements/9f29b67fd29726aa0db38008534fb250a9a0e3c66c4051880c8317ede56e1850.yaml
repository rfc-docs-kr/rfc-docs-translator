              (2) Indicate the backbone.  In this case, the packet has
                  been sent over a virtual link.  The receiving router
                  must be an area border router, and the Router ID
                  specified in the packet (the source router) must be the
                  other end of a configured virtual link.  The receiving
                  interface must also attach to the virtual link's
                  configured Transit area.  If all of these checks
                  succeed, the packet is accepted and is from now on
                  associated with the virtual link (and the backbone
                  area).
