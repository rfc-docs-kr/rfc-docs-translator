          This section describes how Database Description Packets are sent
          to a neighbor. The Database Description packet's Interface MTU
          field is set to the size of the largest IP datagram that can be
          sent out the sending interface, without fragmentation.  Common
          MTUs in use in the Internet can be found in Table 7-1 of
          [Ref22]. Interface MTU should be set to 0 in Database
          Description packets sent over virtual links.
