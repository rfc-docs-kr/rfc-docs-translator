          OSPF enables the flexible configuration of IP subnets.  Each
          route distributed by OSPF has a destination and mask.  Two
          different subnets of the same IP network number may have
          different sizes (i.e., different masks).  This is commonly
          referred to as variable length subnetting.  A packet is routed
          to the best (i.e., longest or most specific) match.  Host routes
          are considered to be subnets whose masks are "all ones"
          (0xffffffff).
