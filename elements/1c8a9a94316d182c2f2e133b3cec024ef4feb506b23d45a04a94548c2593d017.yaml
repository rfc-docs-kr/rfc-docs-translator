              DISCUSSION:
                   At present, the only options that need be passed
                   through UDP are Source Route, Record Route, and Time
                   Stamp.  However, new options may be defined in the
                   future, and UDP need not and should not make any
                   assumptions about the format or content of options it
                   passes to or from the application; an exception to this
                   might be an IP-layer security option.
