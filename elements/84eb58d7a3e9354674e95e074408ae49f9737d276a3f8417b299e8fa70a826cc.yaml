          C: XXXX
          S: B283 NO [BADCHARSET UTF-8] KOI8-R is not supported
         //After this command, the saved result variable contains
         //no messages.  A client that wants to reissue the B283
         //SEARCH command with another CHARSET would have to reissue
         //the B282 command as well.  One possible workaround for
         //this is to include the desired CHARSET parameter
         //in the earliest SEARCH RETURN (SAVE) command in a
         //sequence of related SEARCH commands, to cause
         //the earliest SEARCH in the sequence to fail.
         //A better approach might be to always use CHARSET UTF-8
         //instead.
