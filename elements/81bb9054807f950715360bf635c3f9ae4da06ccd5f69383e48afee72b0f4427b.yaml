     -  Transmit a test packet to the Session-Sender in response to every
        received packet.  The response MUST be generated as immediately as
        possible.  The format and content of the test packet is defined in
        Section 4.2.1.  Prior to the transmission of the test packet, the
        Session-Reflector MUST enter the best possible approximation of
        its actual sending time as its Timestamp (in the packet).  This
        permits the determination of the elapsed time between the
        reception of the packet and its transmission.
