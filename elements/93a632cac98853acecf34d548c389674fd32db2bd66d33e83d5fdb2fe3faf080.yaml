     The end of a TCP session is detected when FIN is acknowledged by both
     halves of the session or when either half receives a segment with the
     RST bit in TCP flags field. However, because it is impossible for a
     NAT device to know whether the packets it sees will actually be
     delivered to the destination (they may be dropped between the NAT
     device and the destination), the NAT device cannot safely assume that
     the segments containing FINs or SYNs will be the last packets of the
     session (i.e., there could be retransmissions).  Consequently, a
     session can be assumed to have been terminated only after a period of
