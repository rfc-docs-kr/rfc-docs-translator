              DISCUSSION:
                   Internet host implementors have used two different
                   conceptual models for multihoming, briefly summarized
                   in the following discussion.  This document takes no
                   stand on which model is preferred; each seems to have a
                   place.  This ambivalence is reflected in the issues (A)
                   and (B) being optional.
