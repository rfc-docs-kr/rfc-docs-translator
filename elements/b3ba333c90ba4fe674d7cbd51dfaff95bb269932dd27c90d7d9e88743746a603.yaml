          This specification does not provide a rollover procedure for the
          cryptographic sequence number. When the cryptographic sequence
          number that the router is sending hits the maximum value, the
          router should reset the cryptographic sequence number that it is
          sending back to 0. After this is done, the router's neighbors
          will reject the router's OSPF packets for a period of
          RouterDeadInterval, and then the router will be forced to
          reestablish all adjacencies over the interface. However, it is
          expected that many implementations will use "seconds since
          reboot" (or "seconds since 1960", etc.) as the cryptographic
          sequence number. Such a choice will essentially prevent
          rollover, since the cryptographic sequence number field is 32
          bits in length.
