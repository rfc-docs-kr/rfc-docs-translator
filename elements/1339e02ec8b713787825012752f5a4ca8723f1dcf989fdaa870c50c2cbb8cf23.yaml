        This attribute is a unique Accounting ID to make it easy to link
        together multiple related sessions in a log file.  Each session
        linked together would have a unique Acct-Session-Id but the same
        Acct-Multi-Session-Id.  It is strongly recommended that the Acct-
        Multi-Session-Id contain UTF-8 encoded 10646 [7] characters.
