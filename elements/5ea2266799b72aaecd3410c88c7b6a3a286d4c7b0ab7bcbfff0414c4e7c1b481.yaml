           An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one
           or more of the MUST requirements for the protocols it
           implements.  An implementation that satisfies all the MUST and
           all the SHOULD requirements for its protocols is said to be
           "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST
           requirements but not all the SHOULD requirements for its
           protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant".
