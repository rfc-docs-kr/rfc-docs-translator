     The election is performed on the responder.  The responder compares
     the Origin-Host received in the CER with its own Origin-Host as two
     streams of octets.  If the local Origin-Host lexicographically
     succeeds the received Origin-Host, a Win-Election event is issued
     locally.  Diameter identities are in ASCII form; therefore, the
     lexical comparison is consistent with DNS case insensitivity, where
     octets that fall in the ASCII range 'a' through 'z' MUST compare
     equally to their uppercase counterparts between 'A' and 'Z'.  See
     Appendix D for interactions between the Diameter protocol and
     Internationalized Domain Name (IDNs).
