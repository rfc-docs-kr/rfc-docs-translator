     Each Diameter application MUST have an IANA-assigned Application ID.
     The base protocol does not require an Application Id since its
     support is mandatory.  During the capabilities exchange, Diameter
     nodes inform their peers of locally supported applications.
     Furthermore, all Diameter messages contain an Application Id, which
     is used in the message forwarding process.
