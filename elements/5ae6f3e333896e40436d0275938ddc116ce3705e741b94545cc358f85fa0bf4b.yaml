              The exact steps for reconstructing the original datagram
              depend on the mode (transport or tunnel) and are described
              in the Security Architecture document.  At a minimum, in an
              IPv6 context, the receiver SHOULD ensure that the decrypted
              data is 8-byte aligned, to facilitate processing by the
              protocol identified in the Next Header field.  This
              processing "discards" any (optional) TFC padding that has
              been added for traffic flow confidentiality.  (If present,
              this will have been inserted after the IP datagram (or
              transport-layer frame) and before the Padding field (see
              Section 2.4).)
