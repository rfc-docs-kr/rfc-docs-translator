     If the protection level indicates that TLS is required, then it
     should be negotiated once the data connection is made.  Thus, the
     '150' reply only states that the command can be used given the
     current PROT level.  Should the server not like the TLS negotiation,
     then it will close the data port immediately and follow the '150'
     command with a '522' reply, which indicates that the TLS negotiation
     failed or was unacceptable.  (Note: This means that the application
     can pass a standard list of CipherSuites to the TLS layer for
     negotiation, and review the one negotiated for applicability in each
     instance).
