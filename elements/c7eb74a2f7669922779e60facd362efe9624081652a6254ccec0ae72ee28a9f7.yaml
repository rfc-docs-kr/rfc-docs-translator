     The receiver of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request (CER) MUST
     determine common applications by computing the intersection of its
     own set of supported Application Ids against all of the
     Application-Id AVPs (Auth-Application-Id, Acct-Application-Id, and
     Vendor-Specific-Application-Id) present in the CER.  The value of the
     Vendor-Id AVP in the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id MUST NOT be used
     during computation.  The sender of the Capabilities-Exchange-Answer
     (CEA) SHOULD include all of its supported applications as a hint to
     the receiver regarding all of its application capabilities.
