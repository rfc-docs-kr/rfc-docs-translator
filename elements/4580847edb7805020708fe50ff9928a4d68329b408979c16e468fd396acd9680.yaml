     At the first failing Command in a Transaction, processing of the
     remaining Commands in that Transaction stops.  If a command contains
     a wildcarded TerminationID, the command is attempted with each of the
     actual TerminationIDs matching the wildcard.  A response within the
     TransactionReply is included for each matching TerminationID, even if
     one or more instances generated an error.  If any TerminationID
     matching a wildcard results in an error when executed, any commands
     following the wildcarded command are not attempted.
