     A physical Media Gateway may be partitioned into one or more Virtual
     MGs.  A virtual MG consists of a set of statically partitioned
     physical Terminations and/or sets of ephemeral Terminations.  A
     physical Termination is controlled by one MGC.  The model does not
     require that other resources be statically allocated, just
     Terminations.  The mechanism for allocating Terminations to virtual
     MGs is a management method outside the scope of the protocol.  Each
     of the virtual MGs appears to the MGC as a complete MG client.
