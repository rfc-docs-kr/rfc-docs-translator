     Using classless prefixes with explicit prefix lengths allows much
     more flexible matching of address space blocks according to actual
     need.  Where formerly only three network sizes were available,
     prefixes may be defined to describe any power of two-sized block of
     between one and 2^32 end system addresses.  In practice, the
     unallocated pool of addresses is administered by the Internet
     Assigned Numbers Authority ([IANA]).  The IANA makes allocations from
     this pool to Regional Internet Registries, as required.  These
     allocations are made in contiguous bit-aligned blocks of 2^24
     addresses (a.k.a. /8 prefixes).  The Regional Internet Registries
     (RIRs), in turn, allocate or assign smaller address blocks to Local
     Internet Registries (LIRs) or Internet Service Providers (ISPs).
     These entities may make direct use of the assignment (as would
     commonly be the case for an ISP) or may make further sub-allocations
     of addresses to their customers.  These RIR address assignments vary
     according to the needs of each ISP or LIR.  For example, a large ISP
     might be allocated an address block of 2^17 addresses (a /15 prefix),
     whereas a smaller ISP may be allocated an address block of 2^11
     addresses (a /21 prefix).
