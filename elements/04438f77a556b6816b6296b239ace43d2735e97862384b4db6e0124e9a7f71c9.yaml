              DISCUSSION:
                   The TTL field has two functions: limit the lifetime of
                   TCP segments (see RFC-793 [TCP:1], p. 28), and
                   terminate Internet routing loops.  Although TTL is a
                   time in seconds, it also has some attributes of a hop-
                   count, since each gateway is required to reduce the TTL
                   field by at least one.
