     Similar to relays, proxy agents route Diameter messages using the
     Diameter routing table.  However, they differ since they modify
     messages to implement policy enforcement.  This requires that proxies
     maintain the state of their downstream peers (e.g., access devices)
     to enforce resource usage, provide admission control, and provide
     provisioning.
