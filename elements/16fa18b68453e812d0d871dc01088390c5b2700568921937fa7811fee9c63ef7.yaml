     An onramp gateway MAY have a user authorization function to confirm
     that the user is authorized to transmit a facsimile to the Internet
     fax service.  For example, user authorization may be accomplished by
     getting a user-ID and password received by Dual Tone Multi-Frequency
     (DTMF), or via a local authorization table based on the GSTN caller-
     ID.
