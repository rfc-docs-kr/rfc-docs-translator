          Each Link State Update packet carries a set of new link state
          advertisements (LSAs) one hop further away from their point of
          origination.  A single Link State Update packet may contain the
          LSAs of several routers.  Each LSA is tagged with the ID of the
          originating router and a checksum of its link state contents.
          Each LSA also has a type field; the different types of OSPF LSAs
          are listed below in Table 9.
