     If the extension is present, the server MAY send a delegated
     credential; if the extension is not present, the server MUST NOT send
     a delegated credential.  When a (D)TLS version negotiated is less
     than 1.3, the server MUST ignore this extension.  An example of when
     a server could choose not to send a delegated credential is when the
     SignatureSchemes listed only contain signature schemes for which a
     corresponding delegated credential does not exist or are otherwise
     unsuitable for the connection.
