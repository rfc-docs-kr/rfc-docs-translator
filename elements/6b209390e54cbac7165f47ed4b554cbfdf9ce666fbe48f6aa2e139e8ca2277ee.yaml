     It is also worthwhile to mention that since aggregation may occur at
     multiple levels in the system, it may still be possible to aggregate
     these anomalous routes at higher levels of whatever hierarchy may be
     present.  For example, if a site is multi-homed to two relatively
     small providers that both obtain connectivity and address space from
     the same large provider, then aggregation by the large provider of
     routes from the smaller networks will include all routes to the
     multi-homed site.  The feasibility of this sort of second-level
     aggregation depends on whether topological hierarchy exists among a
     site, its directly-connected providers, and other providers to which
     they are connected; it may be practical in some regions of the global
     Internet but not in others.
