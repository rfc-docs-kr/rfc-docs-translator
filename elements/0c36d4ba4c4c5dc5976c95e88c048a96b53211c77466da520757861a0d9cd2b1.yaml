     An entire frame can be identified as a sequence of packets beginning
     with a packet having a zero fragment offset and ending with a packet
     having the RTP marker bit set.  Missing packets can be detected
     either with RTP sequence numbers or with the fragment offset and
     lengths of each packet.  Reassembly could be carried out without the
     offset field (i.e., using only the RTP marker bit and sequence
     numbers), but an efficient single-copy implementation would not
     otherwise be possible in the presence of misordered packets.
     Moreover, if the last packet of the previous frame (containing the
     marker bit) were dropped, then a receiver could not always detect
     that the current frame is entirely intact.
