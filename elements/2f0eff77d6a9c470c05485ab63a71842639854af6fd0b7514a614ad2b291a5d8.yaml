     There is an old saying attributed, ironically enough, to the US
     National Security Agency (NSA): "Attacks always get better; they
     never get worse."  Unfortunately, that saying is true, so any
     description of security attacks can only be a snapshot in time.
     Therefore this document reflects our knowledge as of this writing.
     It seems likely that new attacks will be discovered in the future.
