     Similar to OWAMP [RFC4656], TWAMP consists of two inter-related
     protocols: TWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Test.  The relationship of these
     protocols is as defined in Section 1.1 of OWAMP [RFC4656].  TWAMP-
     Control is used to initiate, start, and stop test sessions, whereas
     TWAMP-Test is used to exchange test packets between two TWAMP
     entities.
