     It is also worthwhile to mention that once inter-domain protocols
     which support classless network destinations are widely deployed, the
     rules described by this plan generalize to permit arbitrary

     either allow for non-contiguous subnets to exist in the system or
     that all components of a sub-allocated class A/B will be contained
