          Router RT1 can also determine in this manner the shortest path
          to the AS boundary routers RT5 and RT7.  Then, by looking at RT5
          and RT7's AS-external-LSAs, Router RT1 can decide between RT5 or
          RT7 when sending to a destination in another Autonomous System
          (one of the networks N12-N15).
