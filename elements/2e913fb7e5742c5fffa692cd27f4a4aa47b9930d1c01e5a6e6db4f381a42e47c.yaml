     A topology descriptor is used to specify flow directions between
     terminations in a Context.  Contrary to the descriptors in previous
     sections, the topology descriptor applies to a Context instead of a
     Termination.  The default topology of a Context is that each
     termination's transmission is received by all other terminations. The
     Topology Descriptor is optional to implement.
