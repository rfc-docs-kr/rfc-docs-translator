     *  In its response to the MGC, when the MGC included Local and Remote
        descriptors, the MG SHALL include Local and Remote descriptors for
        all groups of properties and property values it reserved resources
        for.  If the MG is incapable of supporting at least one of the
        alternatives within the Local (Remote) descriptor received from
        the MGC, it SHALL return an empty Local (Remote) descriptor.
