     [a] Lower layer.  The lower layer is responsible for transmitting and
         receiving EAP frames between the peer and authenticator.  EAP has
         been run over a variety of lower layers including PPP, wired IEEE
         802 LANs [IEEE-802.1X], IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs [IEEE-802.11],
         UDP (L2TP [RFC2661] and IKEv2 [IKEv2]), and TCP [PIC].  Lower
         layer behavior is discussed in Section 3.
