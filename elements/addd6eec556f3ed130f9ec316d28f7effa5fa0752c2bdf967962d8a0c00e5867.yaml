     In the late 1980s, the expansion and commercialization of the former
     research network resulted in the connection of many new organizations
     to the rapidly growing Internet, and each new organization required
     an address assignment according to the Class A/B/C addressing plan.
     As demand for new network numbers (particularly in the Class B space)
     took what appeared to be an exponential growth rate, some members of
     the operations and engineering community started to have concerns
     over the long-term scaling properties of the class A/B/C system and
     began thinking about how to modify network number assignment policy
     and routing protocols to accommodate the growth.  In November, 1991,
     the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) created the ROAD (Routing
     and Addressing) group to examine the situation.  This group met in
     January 1992 and identified three major problems:
