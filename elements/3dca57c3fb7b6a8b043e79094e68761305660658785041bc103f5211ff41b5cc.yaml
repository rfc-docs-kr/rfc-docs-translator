     The ASP Active message is sent by an ASP to indicate to a remote M3UA
     peer that it is ready to process signalling traffic for a particular
     Application Server.  The ASP Active message affects only the ASP
     state for the Routing Keys identified by the Routing Contexts, if
     present.
