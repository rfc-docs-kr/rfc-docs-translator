     o  In RFC 2543, closure of a TCP connection was made equivalent to a
        CANCEL.  This was nearly impossible to implement (and wrong) for
        TCP connections between proxies.  This has been eliminated, so
        that there is no coupling between TCP connection state and SIP
        processing.

  - RFC 2543에서는 TCP 연결 종료가 CANCEL과 동일해졌습니다. 이는 프록시 간의 TCP 연결에 대해 구현하는 것이 거의 불가능했으며 잘못되었습니다. 이는 제거되어 TCP 연결 상태와 SIP 처리 간에 결합이 없습니다.
