        Host implementations should be prepared to accept full-length
        packets, however hosts must not send datagrams longer than 576
        octets unless they have explicit knowledge that the destination is
        prepared to accept them.  A host may communicate its size
        preference in TCP based applications via the TCP Maximum Segment
        Size option [10].
