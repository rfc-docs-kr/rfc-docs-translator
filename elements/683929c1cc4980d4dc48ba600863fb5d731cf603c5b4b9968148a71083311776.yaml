     Non-overlapping substrings of the MSK MUST be cryptographically
     separate from each other, as defined in Section 7.2.1.  That is,
     knowledge of one substring MUST NOT help in recovering some other
     substring without breaking some hard cryptographic assumption.  This
     is required because some existing ciphersuites form TSKs by simply
     splitting the AAA-Key to pieces of appropriate length.  Likewise,
     non-overlapping substrings of the EMSK MUST be cryptographically
     separate from each other, and from substrings of the MSK.
