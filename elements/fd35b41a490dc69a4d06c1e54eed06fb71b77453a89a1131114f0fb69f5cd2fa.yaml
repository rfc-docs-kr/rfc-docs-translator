          It is important to note that the above calculation never makes
          unreachable destinations reachable, but instead just potentially
          finds better paths to already reachable destinations.  The
          calculation installs any better cost found into the routing
          table entry, from which it may be readvertised in summary-LSAs
          to other areas.
