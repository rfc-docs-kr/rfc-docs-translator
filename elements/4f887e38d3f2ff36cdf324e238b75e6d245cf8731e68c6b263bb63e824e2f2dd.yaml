     Many TLS endpoints, such as browsers and mail clients, allow the user
     to explicitly accept an invalid server certificate.  This often takes
     the form of a UI dialog (e.g., "do you accept this server?"), and
     users have been conditioned to respond in the affirmative in order to
     allow the connection to take place.
