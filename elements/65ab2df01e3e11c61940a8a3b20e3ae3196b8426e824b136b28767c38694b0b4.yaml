      Network-LSAs are the Type 2 LSAs.  A network-LSA is originated for
      each broadcast and NBMA network in the area which supports two or
      more routers.  The network-LSA is originated by the network's
      Designated Router.  The LSA describes all routers attached to the
      network, including the Designated Router itself.  The LSA's Link
      State ID field lists the IP interface address of the Designated
      Router.
