                     the combined mode algorithm employed and thus not
                     specified in this standard.
                   - The (explicit) ICV field MAY be a part of the ESP
                     packet format when a combined mode algorithm is
                     employed.  If one is not used, an analogous field
                     usually will be a part of the ciphertext payload.
                     The location of any integrity fields, and the means
                     by which the Sequence Number and SPI are included in
                     the integrity computation, MUST be defined in an RFC
                     that defines the use of the combined mode algorithm
                     with ESP.
