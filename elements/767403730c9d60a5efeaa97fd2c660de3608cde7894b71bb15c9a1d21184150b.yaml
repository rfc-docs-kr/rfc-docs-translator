     Possible SS7 address/routing information that comprise a Routing Key
     entry includes, for example, the OPC, DPC, and SIO found in the MTP3
     routing label.  Some example Routing Keys are: the DPC alone, the
     DPC/OPC combination, or the DPC/OPC/SI combination.  The particular
     information used to define an M3UA Routing Key is application and
     network dependent, and none of the above examples are mandated.
