     Note that, as defined, this plan neither requires nor assumes the
     re-assignment of those parts of the legacy "Class C" space that are
     not amenable to aggregation (sometimes called "the swamp").  Doing so
     would somewhat reduce routing table sizes (current estimate is that
     "the swamp" contains approximately 15,000 entries), though at a
     significant renumbering cost.  Similarly, there is no hard
     requirement that any end site renumber when changing transit service
     provider, but end sites are encouraged do so to eliminate the need
     for explicit advertisement of their prefixes into the global routing
     system.
