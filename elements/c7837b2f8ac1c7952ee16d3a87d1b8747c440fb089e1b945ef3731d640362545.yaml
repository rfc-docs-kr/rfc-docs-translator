     For Dynamic Authorization Clients implementing this specification,
     the IPsec policy would be "Initiate IPsec, from me to any,
     destination port UDP 3799".  This causes the Dynamic Authorization
     Client to initiate IPsec when sending Dynamic Authorization traffic
     to any Dynamic Authorization Server.  If some Dynamic Authorization
     Servers contacted by the Dynamic Authorization Client do not support
     IPsec, then a more granular policy will be required, such as
     "Initiate IPsec, from me to IPsec-Capable-DAS, destination port UDP
     3799".
