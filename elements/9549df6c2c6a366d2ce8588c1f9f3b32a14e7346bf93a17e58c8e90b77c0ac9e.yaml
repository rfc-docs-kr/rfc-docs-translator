     The effect of these attacks will typically be limited to denial of
     service, unless the host utilizes its IP configuration for other
     purposes, such as security configuration or location determination.
     For example, a host that disables its personal firewall based on
     evidence that it had attached to a home network could be compromised
     by spoofing of the DNAv4 reachability test.  In general, adjustment
     of the security configuration based on DNAv4 is NOT RECOMMENDED.
