     An EAP conversation MAY utilize a sequence of methods.  A common
     example of this is an Identity request followed by a single EAP
     authentication method such as an MD5-Challenge.  However, the peer
     and authenticator MUST utilize only one authentication method (Type 4
     or greater) within an EAP conversation, after which the authenticator
     MUST send a Success or Failure packet.
