      Link State ID
          This field identifies the portion of the internet environment
          that is being described by the LSA.  The contents of this field
          depend on the LSA's LS type.  For example, in network-LSAs the
          Link State ID is set to the IP interface address of the
          network's Designated Router (from which the network's IP address
          can be derived).  The Link State ID is further discussed in
          Section 12.1.4.
