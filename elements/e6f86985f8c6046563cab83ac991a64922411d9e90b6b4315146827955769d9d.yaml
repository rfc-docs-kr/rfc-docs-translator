     This example provides a simple architecture for responders where
     their role will be to simply act as light test points in the network.
     The controller establishes the test session with the Server through
     non-standard means.  After the session is established, the controller
     transmits test packets to the responder.  The responder follows the
     Session-Reflector behavior of TWAMP as described in section 4.2 with
     the following exceptions.
