     If an authentication algorithm is used that is known to be vulnerable
     to dictionary attacks, then the conversation may be tunneled within a
     protected channel in order to provide additional protection.
     However, as noted in Section 7.4, EAP tunneling may result in a man-
     in-the-middle vulnerability, and therefore dictionary attack
     resistant methods are preferred.
