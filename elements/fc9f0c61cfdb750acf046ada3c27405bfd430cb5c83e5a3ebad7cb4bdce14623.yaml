     The formal syntax of the digit map is described by the DigitMap rule
     in the formal syntax description of the protocol (see Annex A and
     Annex B). A DigitMap, according to this syntax, is defined either by
     a string or by a list of strings. Each string in the list is an
     alternative event sequence, specified either as a sequence of digit
     map symbols or as a regular expression of digit map symbols.  These
     digit map symbols, the digits "0" through "9" and letters "A" through
     a maximum value depending on the signalling system concerned, but
     never exceeding "K", correspond to specified events within a package
     which has been designated in the Events Descriptor on the termination
     to which the digit map is being applied.  (The mapping between events
     and digit map symbols is defined in the documentation for packages
     associated with channel-associated signalling systems such as DTMF,
     MF, or R2.  Digits "0" through "9" MUST be mapped to the
     corresponding digit events within the signalling system concerned.
     Letters should be allocated in logical fashion, facilitating the use
     of range notation for alternative events.)
