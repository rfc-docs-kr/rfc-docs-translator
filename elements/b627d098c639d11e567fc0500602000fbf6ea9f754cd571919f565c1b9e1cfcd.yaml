        The request did not contain an AVP that is required by the Command
        Code definition.  If this value is sent in the Result-Code AVP, a
        Failed-AVP AVP SHOULD be included in the message.  The Failed-AVP
        AVP MUST contain an example of the missing AVP complete with the
        Vendor-Id if applicable.  The value field of the missing AVP
        should be of correct minimum length and contain zeroes.
