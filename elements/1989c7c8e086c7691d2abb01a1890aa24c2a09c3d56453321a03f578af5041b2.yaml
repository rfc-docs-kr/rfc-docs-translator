     With the change from classful network numbers to classless prefixes,
     it is not possible to infer the network mask from the initial bit
     pattern of an IPv4 address.  This has implications for how routing
     information is stored and propagated.  Network masks or prefix
     lengths must be explicitly carried in routing protocols.  Interior
     routing protocols, such as OSPF [RFC2328], Intermediate System to
     Intermediate System (IS-IS) [RFC1195], RIPv2 [RFC2453], and Cisco
     Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), and the BGP4
     exterior routing protocol [RFC4271], all support this functionality,
     having been developed or modified as part of the deployment of
     classless inter-domain routing during the 1990s.
