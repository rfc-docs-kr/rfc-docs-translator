     o  Changed Diameter extensibility.  This includes fixes to the
        Diameter extensibility description (Section 1.3 and others) to
        better aid Diameter application designers; in addition, the new
        specification relaxes the policy with respect to the allocation of
        Command Codes for vendor-specific uses.
