                   An architectural goal for Internet hosts was to allow
                   IP addresses to be featureless 32-bit numbers, avoiding
                   algorithms that required a knowledge of the IP address
                   format.  Otherwise, any future change in the format or
                   interpretation of IP addresses will require host
                   software changes.  However, validation of broadcast and
                   multicast addresses violates this goal; a few other
                   violations are described elsewhere in this document.
