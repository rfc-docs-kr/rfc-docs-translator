     The problem does not exist within the Diameter protocol [RFC3588], in
     which server-initiated authorization change is initiated using a
     Re-Auth-Request (RAR) command identifying the session via User-Name
     and Session-Id Attribute Value Pairs (AVPs) and containing a
     Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP with value "AUTHORIZE_ONLY".  This results
     in initiation of a standard Request/Response sequence where
     authorization changes are supplied.  As a result, in no command can
     Diameter AVPs have multiple potential meanings.
