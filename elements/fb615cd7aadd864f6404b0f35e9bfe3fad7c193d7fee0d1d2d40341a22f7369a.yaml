        Usage: Despite the problems in the X.509 definition, the term
        itself is useful in describing applications of asymmetric
        cryptography. The way the term is used in X.509 implies that it
        was meant to be defined, as we have done here, relative to roles
        that an entity (which is associated with an OSI end system) is
        playing or is permitted to play in applications of asymmetric
        cryptography other than the PKI that supports applications.

  - 사용법: X.509 정의의 문제에도 불구하고 용어 자체는 비대칭 암호화 응용 프로그램을 설명하는 데 유용합니다. X.509에서 용어가 사용되는 방식은 여기서 수행한 것처럼 엔터티(OSI 최종 시스템과 관련됨)가 수행하고 있거나 응용 프로그램에서 수행하도록 허용된 역할과 관련하여 정의되어야 함을 의미합니다. 애플리케이션을 지원하는 PKI 이외의 비대칭 암호화.
