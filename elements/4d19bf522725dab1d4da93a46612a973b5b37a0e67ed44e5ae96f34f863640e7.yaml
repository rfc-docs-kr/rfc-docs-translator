        Note: The M-bit setting for a given AVP is relevant to an
        Application and each command within that application that includes
        the AVP.  That is, if an AVP appears in two commands for
        application Foo and the M-bit settings are different in each
        command, then there should be two AVP flag tables describing when
        to set the M-bit.
