              The E-bit represents OSPF's ExternalRoutingCapability.  This
              bit should be set in all LSAs associated with the backbone,
              and all LSAs associated with non-stub areas (see Section
              3.6).  It should also be set in all AS-external-LSAs.  It
              should be reset in all router-LSAs, network-LSAs and
              summary-LSAs associated with a stub area.  For all LSAs, the
              setting of the E-bit is for informational purposes only; it
              does not affect the routing table calculation.
