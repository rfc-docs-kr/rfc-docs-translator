     In the case of TWAMP Light, the Session-Reflector does not
     necessarily have knowledge of the session state.  IF the Session-
     Reflector does not have knowledge of the session state, THEN the
     Session-Reflector MUST copy the Sequence Number of the received
     packet to the Sequence Number field of the reflected packet.  The
     controller receives the reflected test packets and collects two-way
     metrics.  This architecture allows for collection of two-way metrics.
