     Note also that the original ChaCha had a 64-bit nonce and 64-bit
     block count.  We have modified this here to be more consistent with
     recommendations in Section 3.2 of [RFC5116].  This limits the use of
     a single (key,nonce) combination to 2^32 blocks, or 256 GB, but that
     is enough for most uses.  In cases where a single key is used by
     multiple senders, it is important to make sure that they don't use
     the same nonces.  This can be assured by partitioning the nonce space
     so that the first 32 bits are unique per sender, while the other 64
     bits come from a counter.
