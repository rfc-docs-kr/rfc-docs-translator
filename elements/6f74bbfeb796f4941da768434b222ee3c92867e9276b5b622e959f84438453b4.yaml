     An Internet Fax Gateway provides connectivity and translation between
     the General Switched Telephone Network facsimile service (GSTN fax)
     and the e-mail-based Internet Fax service (i-fax).  This document
     defines the recommended behavior of an Internet Fax Gateway.  An
     Internet Fax Gateway can be classified as "onramp", when a facsimile
     is transferred from GSTN fax to the Internet Fax, and as "offramp",
     when a facsimile is transferred from Internet Fax to GSTN fax.  For a
     more detailed definition of "onramp" and "offramp" within i-fax
     service, see [1].
