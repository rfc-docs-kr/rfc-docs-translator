              In addition, the Link Data field is specified for each link.
              This field gives 32 bits of extra information for the link.
              For links to transit networks, numbered point-to-point links
              and virtual links, this field specifies the IP interface
              address of the associated router interface (this is needed
              by the routing table calculation, see Section 16.1.1).  For
              links to stub networks, this field specifies the stub
              network's IP address mask.  For unnumbered point-to-point
              links, the Link Data field should be set to the unnumbered
              interface's MIB-II [Ref8] ifIndex value.
