      Area
          This field indicates the area whose link state information has
          led to the routing table entry's collection of paths.  This is
          called the entry's associated area.  For sets of AS external
          paths, this field is not defined.  For destinations of type
          "router", there may be separate sets of paths (and therefore
          separate routing table entries) associated with each of several
          areas. For example, this will happen when two area border
          routers share multiple areas in common.  For destinations of
          type "network", only the set of paths associated with the best
          area (the one providing the preferred route) is kept.
