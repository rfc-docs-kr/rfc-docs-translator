     23. The MGC now sets up both MG1 and MG2 to be ready to detect the
     next off-hook event. See step 1. Note that this could be the default
     state of a termination in the null context, and if this were the
     case, no message need be sent from the MGC to the MG. Once a
     termination returns to the null context, it goes back to the default
     termination values for that termination.
