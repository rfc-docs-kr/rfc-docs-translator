              DISCUSSION:
                   A Source Quench may be generated by the target host or
                   by some gateway in the path of a datagram.  The host
                   receiving a Source Quench should throttle itself back
                   for a period of time, then gradually increase the
                   transmission rate again.  The mechanism to respond to
                   Source Quench may be in the transport layer (for
                   connection-oriented protocols like TCP) or in the
                   application layer (for protocols that are built on top
                   of UDP).
