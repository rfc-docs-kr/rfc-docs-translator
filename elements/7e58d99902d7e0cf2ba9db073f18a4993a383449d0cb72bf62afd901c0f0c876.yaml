     An MUA MUST NOT consult SRV records to determine which servers to use
     on every connection attempt, unless those SRV records are signed by
     DNSSEC and have a valid signature.  However, an MUA MAY consult SRV
     records from time to time to determine if an MSP's server
     configuration has changed and alert the user if it appears that this
     has happened.  This can also serve as a means to encourage users to
     upgrade their configurations to require TLS if and when their MSPs
     support it.
