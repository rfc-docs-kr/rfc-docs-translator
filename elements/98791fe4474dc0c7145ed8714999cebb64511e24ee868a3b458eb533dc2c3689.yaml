     The time window used for duplicate detection MUST be the same as the
     window used to detect a stale Event-Timestamp Attribute.  Since the
     RADIUS Identifier cannot be repeated within the selected time window,
     no more than 256 Requests can be accepted within the time window.  As
     a result, the chosen time window will depend on the expected maximum
     volume of CoA/Disconnect-Requests, so that unnecessary discards can
     be avoided.  A default time window of 300 seconds should be adequate
     in many circumstances.
