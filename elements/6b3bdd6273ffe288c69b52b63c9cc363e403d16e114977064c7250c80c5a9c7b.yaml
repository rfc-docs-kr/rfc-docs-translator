     If one or more encodings have been applied to a representation, the
     sender that applied the encodings MUST generate a Content-Encoding
     header field that lists the content codings in the order in which
     they were applied.  Note that the coding named "identity" is reserved
     for its special role in Accept-Encoding and thus SHOULD NOT be
     included.

  하나 이상의 인코딩이 표현에 적용된 경우 인코딩을 적용한 발신자는 적용된 순서대로 콘텐츠 코딩을 나열하는 Content-Encoding 헤더 필드를 생성해야 합니다. "identity"라는 코딩은 Accept-Encoding의 특별한 역할을 위해 예약되어 있으므로 포함되어서는 안 됩니다.
