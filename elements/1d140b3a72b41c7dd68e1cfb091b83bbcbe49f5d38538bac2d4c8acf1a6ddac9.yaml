     When operating as a "pass-through authenticator", an authenticator
     performs checks on the Code, Identifier, and Length fields as
     described in Section 4.1.  It forwards EAP packets received from the
     peer and destined to its authenticator layer to the backend
     authentication server; packets received from the backend
     authentication server destined to the peer are forwarded to it.
