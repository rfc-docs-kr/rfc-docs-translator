        indicators to provide some amount of error detection and
        correction.  If the frame not copied bit is set but the address
        not recognized bit is reset, receiver congestion has occurred.  It
        is suggested, though not required, that hosts should retransmit
        the offending packet a small number of times (4) or until
        congestion no longer occurs.  If the address not recognized bit is
        set, an implementation has 3 options: (1) ignore the error and
        throw the packet away, (2) return an ICMP destination unreachable
        message to the source, or (3) delete the ARP entry which was used
        to send this packet and send a new ARP request to the destination
        address.  The latter option is the preferred approach since it
        will allow graceful recovery from first hop bridge and router
        failures and changed hardware addresses.
