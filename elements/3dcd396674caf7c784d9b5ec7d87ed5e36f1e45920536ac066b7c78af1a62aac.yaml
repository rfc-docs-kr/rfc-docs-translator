     CoA-Request packets contain information for dynamically changing
     session authorizations.  Typically, this is used to change data
     filters.  The data filters can be of either the ingress or egress
     kind, and are sent in addition to the identification attributes as
     described in Section 3.  The port used and packet format (described
     in Section 2.3) are the same as those for Disconnect-Request packets.
