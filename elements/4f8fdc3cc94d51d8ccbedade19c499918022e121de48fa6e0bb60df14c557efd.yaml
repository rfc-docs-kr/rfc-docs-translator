     The M3UA Layer at an ASP or IPSP provides the equivalent set of
     primitives at its upper layer to the MTP3-Users as provided by the
     MTP Level 3 to its local MTP3-Users at an SS7 SEP.  In this way, the
     ISUP and/or SCCP layer at an ASP or IPSP is unaware that the expected
     MTP3 services are offered remotely from an MTP3 Layer at an SGP, and
     not by a local MTP3 layer.  The MTP3 layer at an SGP may also be
     unaware that its local users are actually remote user parts over
     M3UA.  In effect, the M3UA extends access to the MTP3 layer services
     to a remote IP-based application.  The M3UA layer does not itself
     provide the MTP3 services.  However, in the case where an ASP is
     connected to more than one SG, the M3UA layer at an ASP should
     maintain the status of configured SS7 destinations and route messages
     according to the availability and congestion status of the routes to
     these destinations via each SG.
