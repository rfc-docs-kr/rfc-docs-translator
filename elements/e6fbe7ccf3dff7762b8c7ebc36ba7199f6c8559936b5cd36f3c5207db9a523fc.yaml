              If the newly added vertex is a transit network, the routing
              table entry for the network is located.  The entry's
              Destination ID is the IP network number, which can be
              obtained by masking the Vertex ID (Link State ID) with its
              associated subnet mask (found in the body of the associated
              network-LSA).  If the routing table entry already exists
              (i.e., there is already an intra-area route to the
              destination installed in the routing table), multiple
              vertices have mapped to the same IP network.  For example,
              this can occur when a new Designated Router is being
              established.  In this case, the current routing table entry
              should be overwritten if and only if the newly found path is
              just as short and the current routing table entry's Link
              State Origin has a smaller Link State ID than the newly
              added vertex' LSA.
