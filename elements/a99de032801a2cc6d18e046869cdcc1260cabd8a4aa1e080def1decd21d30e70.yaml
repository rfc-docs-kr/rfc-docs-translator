                Note that 894-only systems cannot interoperate directly
                with 1042-only systems.  If the two system types are set
                up as two different logical networks on the same cable,
                they can communicate only through an IP gateway.
                Furthermore, it is not useful or even possible for a
                dual-format host to discover automatically which format to
                send, because of the problem of link-layer broadcasts.
