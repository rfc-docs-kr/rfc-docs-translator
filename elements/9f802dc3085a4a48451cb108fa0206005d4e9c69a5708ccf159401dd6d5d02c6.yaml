     If a media stream is UDP-based (such as RTP), an agent MAY use an
     additional host TCP candidate to request a UDP-based candidate from a
     TURN server (or some other relay with similar functionality).  Usage
     of such UDP candidates follows the procedures defined in ICE for UDP
     candidates.
