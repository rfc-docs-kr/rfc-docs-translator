        A point within a routing domain corresponds to a subnetwork. If a
        domain is composed of multiple subnetworks, they are
        interconnected via routers.  Leaf routing domains correspond to
        sites, where the primary purpose is to provide intra-domain
        routing services. Transit routing domains are deployed to carry
        transit (i.e., inter-domain) traffic; backbones and providers are
        TRDs.
