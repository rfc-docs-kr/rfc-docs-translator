     Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care
     and sparingly.  In particular, they MUST only be used where it is
     actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has
     potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)  For
     example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method
     on implementors where the method is not required for
     interoperability.
