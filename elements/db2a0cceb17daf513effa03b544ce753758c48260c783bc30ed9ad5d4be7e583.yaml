  diffServSchedulerMaxRate OBJECT-TYPE
      SYNTAX       RowPointer
      MAX-ACCESS   read-create
      STATUS       current
      DESCRIPTION
         "This RowPointer indicates the entry in diffServMaxRateTable
         which indicates the maximum output rate from this scheduler.
         When more than one maximum rate applies (eg, when a multi-rate
         shaper is in view), it points to the first of those rate entries.
         This attribute is used only when there is more than one level of
         scheduler.
