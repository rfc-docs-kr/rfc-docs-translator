     The use of RowPointers as connectors allows for the simple extension
     of the MIB.  The RowPointers, whether "next" or "specific", may point
     to Entries defined in other MIB modules.  For example, the only type
     of meter defined in this MIB is a token bucket meter; if another type
     of meter is required, another MIB could be defined describing that
     type of meter, and diffServMeterSpecific could point to it.
     Similarly, if a new action is required, the "next" pointer of the
     previous functional datapath element could point to an Entry defined
     in another MIB, public or proprietary.
