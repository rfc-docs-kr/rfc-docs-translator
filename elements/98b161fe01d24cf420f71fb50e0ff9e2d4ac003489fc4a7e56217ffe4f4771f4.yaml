     The Diameter protocol requires that agents maintain transaction
     state, which is used for failover purposes.  Transaction state
     implies that upon forwarding a request, its Hop-by-Hop Identifier is
     saved; the field is replaced with a locally unique identifier, which
     is restored to its original value when the corresponding answer is
     received.  The request's state is released upon receipt of the
     answer.  A stateless agent is one that only maintains transaction
     state.
