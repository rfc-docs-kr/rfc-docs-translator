         *  The encoded message in EMSA-PSS has nine fixed bits; the first
            bit is 0 and the last eight bits form a "trailer field", the
            octet 0xbc.  In the original scheme, only the first bit is
            fixed.  The rationale for the trailer field is for
            compatibility with the Integer Factorization Signature
            Primitive using Rabin-Williams (IFSP-RW) in IEEE 1363
            [IEEE1363] and the corresponding primitive in ISO/IEC
            9796-2:2010 [ISO9796].
