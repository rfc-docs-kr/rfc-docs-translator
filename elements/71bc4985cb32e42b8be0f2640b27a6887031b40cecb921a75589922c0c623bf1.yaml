     For non-STUN data, the agent appends this to the ongoing byte stream
     collected from the frames.  It then parses the byte stream as if it
     had been directly received over the TCP connection.  This allows for
     ICE TCP to work without regard to the framing mechanism used by the
     application-layer protocol.
