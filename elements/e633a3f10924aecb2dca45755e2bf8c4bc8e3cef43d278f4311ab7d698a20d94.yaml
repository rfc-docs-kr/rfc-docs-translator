        The current standard for token ring's, IEEE 802.5-1985, specifies
        the operation of single ring networks.  However, most
        implementations of 802.5 have added extensions for multi-ring
        networks using source-routing of packets at the MAC layer.  There
        is now a Draft Addendum to IEEE 802.5, "Enhancement for Multi-Ring
        Networks" which attempts to standardize these extensions.
        Unfortunately, the most recent draft (November 10, 1987) is still
        rapidly evolving.  More importantly, it differs significantly from
        the existing implementations.  Therefore, the existing
        implementations of 802.5 [13] are described but no attempt is made
        to specify any future standard.
