     Routing control is a significant aspect of Internet traffic
     engineering.  Routing impacts many of the key performance measures
     associated with networks, such as throughput, delay, and utilization.
     Generally, it is very difficult to provide good service quality in a
     wide area network without effective routing control.  A desirable TE
     routing system is one that takes traffic characteristics and network
     constraints into account during route selection while maintaining
     stability.

  라우팅 제어는 인터넷 트래픽 엔지니어링의 중요한 측면입니다. 라우팅은 처리량, 지연, 활용도 등 네트워크와 관련된 여러 주요 성능 측정에 영향을 미칩니다. 일반적으로 효과적인 라우팅 제어 없이는 광역 네트워크에서 좋은 서비스 품질을 제공하기가 매우 어렵습니다. 바람직한 TE 라우팅 시스템은 안정성을 유지하면서 경로 선택 중에 트래픽 특성과 네트워크 제약 조건을 고려하는 시스템입니다.
