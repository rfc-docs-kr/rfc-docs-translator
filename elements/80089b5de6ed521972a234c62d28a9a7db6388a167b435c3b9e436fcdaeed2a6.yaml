     The provider would then maintain further delegations of naming
     authority for each individual class-C network which it assigns,
     rather than having each registered separately. Note that due to the
     way the DNS is designed, it is still possible for the root
     nameservers to maintain the delegation information for individual
     networks for which the provider is unwilling or unable to do so. This
     should greatly reduce the load on the domain servers for the "top"
     levels of the IN-ADDR.ARPA domain.  The example above illustrates
     only the records for a single nameserver.  In the normal case, there
     are usually several nameservers for each domain, thus the size of the
     examples will double or triple in the common cases.
