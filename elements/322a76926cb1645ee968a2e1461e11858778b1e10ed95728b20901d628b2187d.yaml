           The resource is the conceptual mapping to an entity or set of
           entities, not necessarily the entity which corresponds to that
           mapping at any particular instance in time.  Thus, a resource
           can remain constant even when its content---the entities to
           which it currently corresponds---changes over time, provided
           that the conceptual mapping is not changed in the process.
