     For each sibling set, the server determines which nodes are included
     (or potentially included) in the filter output, and which sibling
     subtrees are excluded (pruned) from the filter output.  The server
     first determines which types of nodes are present in the sibling set
     and processes the nodes according to the rules for their type.  If
     any nodes in the sibling set are selected, then the process is
     recursively applied to the sibling sets of each selected node.  The
     algorithm continues until all sibling sets in all subtrees specified
     in the filter have been processed.
