     The NETCONF protocol defines a simple mechanism through which a
     network device can be managed, configuration data information can be
     retrieved, and new configuration data can be uploaded and
     manipulated.  The protocol allows the device to expose a full, formal
     application programming interface (API).  Applications can use this
     straightforward API to send and receive full and partial
     configuration data sets.
