          There is still the possibility of a routing loop in RFC 2178
          when both a) virtual links are in use and b) the same external
          route is being imported by multiple ASBRs, each of which is in a
          separate area. To fix this problem, Section 16.4.1 has been
          revised. To choose the correct ASBR/forwarding address, intra-
          area paths through non-backbone areas are always preferred.
          However, intra-area paths through the backbone area (Area 0) and
          inter-area paths are now of equal preference, and must be
          compared solely based on cost.
