     The time required to detect movement between networks and to obtain
     (or to continue to use) an IPv4 configuration may be significant as a
     fraction of the total handover latency in moving between points of
     attachment.  This document synthesizes, from experience in the
     deployment of hosts supporting ARP, DHCP, and IPv4 Link-Local
     addresses, a set of steps known as Detecting Network Attachment for
     IPv4 (DNAv4), in order to decrease the handover latency in moving
     between points of attachment.
