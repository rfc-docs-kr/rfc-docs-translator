     Successful Authentication
        In the context of this document, "successful authentication" is an
        exchange of EAP messages, as a result of which the authenticator
        decides to allow access by the peer, and the peer decides to use
        this access.  The authenticator's decision typically involves both
        authentication and authorization aspects; the peer may
        successfully authenticate to the authenticator, but access may be
        denied by the authenticator due to policy reasons.
