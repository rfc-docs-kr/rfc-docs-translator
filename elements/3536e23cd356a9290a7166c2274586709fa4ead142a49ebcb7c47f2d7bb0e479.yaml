     Presently, it is estimated that there are fewer than 100 multi-homed
     organizations connected to the Internet. Each such organization's
     network is comprised of one or more network numbers.  In many cases
     (and in all future cases under this plan), the network numbers used
     by an organization are consecutive, meaning that aggregation of those
     networks during route advertisement may be possible. This means that
     the number of routes advertised within the Internet for multi-homed
     networks may be approximated as the total number of multi-homed
     organizations.  Assuming that the number of multi-homed organization
     will double every year (which may be a over-estimation, given that
     every connection costs money), the number of routes for multi-homed
     networks would be expected to grow to approximately 800 in three
     years.
