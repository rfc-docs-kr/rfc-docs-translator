     To illustrate the problem alluded to by the "note" in section 4.2,
     consider what happens if RA loses connectivity to C7 (the client
     which is allocated out of RB's space). In a stateful protocol, RA
     will announce to BB that 192.32.0.0/255.255.240.0 has become
     unreachable. Now, when BB flushes this information out of its routing
     table, any future traffic sent through it for this destination will
     be forwarded to RB (where it will be dropped according to Rule #2) by
     virtue of RB's less specific match 192.32.0.0/255.248.0.0.  While
     this does not cause an operational problem (C7 is unreachable in any
     case), it does create some extra traffic across "BB" (and may also
     prove confusing to a network manager debugging the outage with
     "traceroute"). A mechanism to cache such unreachability information
     would help here, but is beyond the scope of this document (such a
     mechanism is also not implementable in the near-term).
