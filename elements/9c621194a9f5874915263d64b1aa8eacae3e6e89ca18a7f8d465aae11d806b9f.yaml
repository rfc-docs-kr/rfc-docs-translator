     The technical work in 3GPP2 is organized in Technical Specification
     Groups TSGs each with their area of responsibilities.  TSG-A and
     TSG-C are responsible for the Radio Access networks based on CDMA and
     thus the experts in the areas of the characteristics of the physical
     transport.  TSG-N is responsible for the Mobility Management and
     other core network protocol and functionalities.  TSG-P is
     responsible for data services and applications.  TSG-S is responsible
     for the service and system aspects including the overall
     architecture, security and O&M aspects.  Contacts for the TSGs can be
     found on the 3GPP2 web-site www.3gpp2.org.
