     The TCP connectivity checks, like with UDP, are generated only by
     full implementations.  The TCP candidate pairs are in the same check
     list with the UDP candidate pairs, and they are scheduled for
     connectivity checks, as described in Section 5.8 of [RFC5245], based
     on the priority order.
