          As an example, consider Router RT4 in Figure 6.  It is an area
          border router, having a connection to Area 1 and the backbone.
          Router RT4 originates 5 distinct LSAs into the backbone (one
          router-LSA, and one summary-LSA for each of the networks N1-N4).
          Router RT4 will also originate 8 distinct LSAs into Area 1 (one
          router-LSA and seven summary-LSAs as pictured in Figure 7).  If
          RT4 has been selected as Designated Router for Network N3, it
          will also originate a network-LSA for N3 into Area 1.
