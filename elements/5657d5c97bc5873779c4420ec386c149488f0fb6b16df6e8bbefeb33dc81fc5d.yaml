     The letter "x" is used as a wildcard, designating any event
     corresponding to symbols in the range "0"-"9".  The string may also
     contain explicit ranges and, more generally, explicit sets of
     symbols, designating alternative events any one of which satisfies
     that position of the digit map.  Finally, the dot symbol "." stands
     for zero or more repetitions of the event selector (event, range of
     events, set of alternative events, or wildcard) that precedes it. As
     a consequence of the third timing rule above, inter-event timing
     while matching a terminal dot symbol uses the short timer by default.
