     A classic retransmission algorithm would simply count the number of
     successive repetitions, and conclude that the association is broken
     after retransmitting the packet an excessive number of times
     (typically between 7 and 11 times.) In order to account for the
     possibility of an undetected or in-progress "failover", we modify
     the classic algorithm so that if the Media Gateway receives a valid
     ServiceChange message announcing a failover, it will start
     transmitting outstanding commands to that new MGC.  Responses to
     commands are still transmitted to the source address of the command.
