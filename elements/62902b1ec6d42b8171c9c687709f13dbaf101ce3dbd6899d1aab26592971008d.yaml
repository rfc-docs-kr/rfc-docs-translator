        Phase / Explanation
        -------------------
        1. Request service: Before the critical action, the service
           requester asks, either implicitly or explicitly, to have
           evidence of the action be generated.
        2. Generate evidence: When the critical action occurs, evidence is
           generated by a process involving the potential repudiator and
           possibly also a trusted third party.
        3. Transfer evidence: The evidence is transferred to the requester
           or stored by a third party, for later use (if needed).
        4. Verify evidence: The entity that holds the evidence tests it to
           be sure that it will suffice if a dispute arises.
        5. Retain evidence: The evidence is retained for possible future
           retrieval and use.
        6. Resolve dispute: In this phase, which occurs only if the
           critical action is repudiated, the evidence is retrieved from
           storage, presented, and verified to resolve the dispute.
