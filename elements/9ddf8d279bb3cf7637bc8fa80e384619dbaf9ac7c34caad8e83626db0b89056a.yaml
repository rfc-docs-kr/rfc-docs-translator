     When an event is processed against the contents of an active Events
     descriptor and found to be present in that descriptor ("recognized"),
     the default action of the MG is to send a Notify command to the MG.
     Notification may be deferred if the event is absorbed into the
     current dial string of an active digit map (see section 7.1.14).  Any
     other action is for further study.  Moreover, event recognition may
     cause currently active signals to stop, or may cause the current
     Events and/or Signals descriptor to be replaced, as described at the
     end of this section.
