        The DRST message is optionally sent from the SGP to all concerned
        ASPs to indicate that the SG has determined that one or more SS7
        destinations are now restricted from the point of view of the SG,
        or in response to a DAUD message, if appropriate.  The M3UA layer
        at the ASP is expected to send traffic to the affected destination
        via an alternate SG with a route of equal priority, but only if
        such an alternate route exists and is available.  If the affected
        destination is currently considered unavailable by the ASP, The
        MTP3-User should be informed that traffic to the affected
        destination can be resumed.  In this case, the M3UA layer should
        route the traffic through the SG initiating the DRST message.
