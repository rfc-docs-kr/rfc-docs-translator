     Note that the terms "allocate" and "assign" have specific meaning in
     the Internet address registry system; "allocate" refers to the
     delegation of a block of address space to an organization that is
     expected to perform further sub-delegations, and "assign" is used for
     sites that directly use (i.e., number individual hosts) the block of
     addresses received.
