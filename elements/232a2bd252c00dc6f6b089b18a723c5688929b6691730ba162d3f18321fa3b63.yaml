     A NAT router sits at the border between two address realms and
     translates addresses in IP headers so that when the packet leaves one
     realm and enters another, it can be routed properly. Because NAT
     devices have connections to multiple address realms, they must be
     careful to not improperly propagate information (e.g., via routing
     protocols) about networks from one address realm into another, where
     such an advertisement would be deemed unacceptable.
