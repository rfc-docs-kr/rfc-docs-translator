     This document describes an extension to the SMTP (Simple Mail
     Transfer Protocol) service that allows an SMTP server and client to
     use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to provide private, authenticated
     communication over the Internet.  This gives SMTP agents the ability
     to protect some or all of their communications from eavesdroppers and
     attackers.
