                  o   If the neighboring router is fully adjacent, add a
                      Type 1 link (point-to-point). The Link ID should be
                      set to the Router ID of the neighboring router. For
                      numbered point-to-point networks, the Link Data
                      should specify the IP interface address. For
                      unnumbered point-to-point networks, the Link Data
                      field should specify the interface's MIB-II [Ref8]
                      ifIndex value. The cost should be set to the output
                      cost of the point-to-point interface.
