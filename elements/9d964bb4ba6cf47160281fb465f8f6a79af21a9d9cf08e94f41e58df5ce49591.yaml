           3. Encrypt and integrity protect the result using the key
              and combined mode algorithm specified for the SA and using
              any required cryptographic synchronization data.
                   - If explicit cryptographic synchronization data,
                     e.g., an IV, is indicated, it is input to the
                     combined mode algorithm per the algorithm
                     specification and placed in the Payload field.
                   - If implicit cryptographic synchronization data is
                     employed, it is constructed and input to the
                     encryption algorithm as per the algorithm
                     specification.
                   - The Sequence Number (or Extended Sequence Number, as
                     appropriate) and the SPI are inputs to the
                     algorithm, as they must be included in the integrity
                     check computation.  The means by which these values
                     are included in this computation are a function of
