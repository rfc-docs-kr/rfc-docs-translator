                Sometimes host implementors have designed for less
                ambitious goals.  For example, the LAN environment is
                typically much more benign than the Internet as a whole;
                LANs have low packet loss and delay and do not reorder
                packets.  Some vendors have fielded host implementations
                that are adequate for a simple LAN environment, but work
                badly for general interoperation.  The vendor justifies
                such a product as being economical within the restricted
                LAN market.  However, isolated LANs seldom stay isolated
                for long; they are soon gatewayed to each other, to
                organization-wide internets, and eventually to the global
                Internet system.  In the end, neither the customer nor the
                vendor is served by incomplete or substandard Internet
                host software.
