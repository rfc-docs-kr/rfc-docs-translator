     The Named Data Networking (NDN) project (http://named-data.net) has
     developed ndnSIM [ndnSIM] [ndnSIM2]; this is a module that can be
     plugged into the ns-3 simulator (https://www.nsnam.org) and supports
     the core features of NDN.  One can use ndnSIM to experiment with
     various NDN applications and services as well as components developed
     for NDN such as routing protocols and caching and forwarding
     strategies, among others.  The code for ns-3 and ndnSIM is openly
     available to the community and can be used as the basis for
     implementing ICN protocols or applications.  For more details, see
     <http://ndnsim.net/2.0/>.
