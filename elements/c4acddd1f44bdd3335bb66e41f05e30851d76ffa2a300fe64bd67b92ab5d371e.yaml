          An LSA can be flushed from the routing domain by setting its LS
          age to MaxAge, while leaving its LS sequence number alone, and
          then reflooding the LSA.  This procedure follows the same course
          as flushing an LSA whose LS age has naturally reached the value
          MaxAge (see Section 14).  In particular, the MaxAge LSA is
          removed from the router's link state database as soon as a) it
          is no longer contained on any neighbor Link state retransmission
          lists and b) none of the router's neighbors are in states
          Exchange or Loading.  We call the setting of an LSA's LS age to
          MaxAge "premature aging".
