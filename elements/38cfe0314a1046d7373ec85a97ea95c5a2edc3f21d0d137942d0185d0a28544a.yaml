     However, HMAC-SHA-1 [HMAC-SHA] and HMAC-MD5 [HMAC-MD5] are currently
     considered of sufficient strength to serve both as IKE generators of
     128-bit AES keys and as ESP authenticators for AES encryption using
     128-bit keys.

  그러나 HMAC-SHA-1 [HMAC-SHA] 및 HMAC-MD5 [HMAC-MD5]는 현재 128비트 AES 키의 IKE 생성기 및 128비트 AES 암호화를 위한 ESP 인증자 역할을 모두 수행하기에 충분한 강도로 간주됩니다. 열쇠.
