     o  The M-bit allows the sender to indicate to the receiver whether or
        not understanding the semantics of an AVP and its content is
        mandatory.  If the M-bit is set by the sender and the receiver
        does not understand the AVP or the values carried within that AVP,
        then a failure is generated (see Section 7).
