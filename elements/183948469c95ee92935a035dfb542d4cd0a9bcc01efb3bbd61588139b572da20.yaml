     It may be of interest to note that IKE (Session key negotiation
     protocol) is a UDP based session layer protocol and is not protected
     by network based IPsec security. Only a portion of the individual
     payloads within IKE are protected. As a result, IKE sessions are
     permissible across NAT, so long as IKE payload does not contain
     addresses and/or transport IDs specific to one realm and not the
     other. Given that IKE is used to setup IPSec associations, and there
     are at present no known ways of making IPSec work through a NAT
     function, it is a future work item to take advantage of IKE through a
     NAT box.
