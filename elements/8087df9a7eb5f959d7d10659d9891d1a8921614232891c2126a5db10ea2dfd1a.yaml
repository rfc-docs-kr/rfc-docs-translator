      Changes made to routing table entries as a result of these
      calculations can cause the OSPF protocol to take further actions.
      For example, a change to an intra-area route will cause an area
      border router to originate new summary-LSAs (see Section 12.4).  See
      Section 16.7 for a complete list of the OSPF protocol actions
      resulting from routing table changes.
