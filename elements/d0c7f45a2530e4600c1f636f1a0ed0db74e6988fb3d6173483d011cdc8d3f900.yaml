     The protocol, therefore, MUST minimally support options for both
     confidentiality and authentication.  It is anticipated that the
     underlying protocol (SSH, BEEP, etc.) will provide for both
     confidentiality and authentication, as is required.  It is further
     expected that the identity of each end of a NETCONF session will be
     available to the other in order to determine authorization for any
     given request.  One could also easily envision additional
     information, such as transport and encryption methods, being made
     available for purposes of authorization.  NETCONF itself provides no
     means to re-authenticate, much less authenticate.  All such actions
     occur at lower layers.
