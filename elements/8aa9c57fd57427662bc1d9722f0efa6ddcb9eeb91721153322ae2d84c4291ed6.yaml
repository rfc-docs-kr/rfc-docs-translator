     Since a RowPointer is not tied to any specific object except by the
     value it contains, it is possible and acceptable to use RowPointers
     to merge data paths.  An obvious example of such a use is in the
     classifier: traffic matching the DSCPs AF11, AF12, and AF13 might be
     presented to the same meter in order to perform the processing
     described in the Assured Forwarding PHB.  Another use would be to
     merge data paths from several interfaces; if they represent a single
     service contract, having them share a common set of counters and
     common policy may be a desirable configuration.  Note well, however,
     that such configurations may have related implementation issues - if
     Differentiated Services processing for the interfaces is implemented
     in multiple forwarding engines, the engines will need to communicate
     if they are to implement such a feature.  An implementation that
     fails to provide this capability is not considered to have failed the
     intention of this MIB or of the [MODEL]; an implementation that does
     provide it is not considered superior from a standards perspective.
