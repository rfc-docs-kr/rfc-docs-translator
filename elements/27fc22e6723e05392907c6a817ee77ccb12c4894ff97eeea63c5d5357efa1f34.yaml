         *  Supply-side congestion management policies increase the
            effective capacity available to traffic in order to control or
            reduce congestion.  This can be accomplished by increasing
            capacity or by balancing distribution of traffic over the
            network.  Capacity planning aims to provide a physical
            topology and associated link bandwidths that match or exceed
            estimated traffic workload and traffic distribution, subject
            to traffic forecasts and budgetary (or other) constraints.  If
            the actual traffic distribution does not fit the topology
            derived from capacity planning, then the traffic can be mapped
            onto the topology by using routing control mechanisms, by
            applying path-oriented technologies (e.g., MPLS LSPs and
            optical channel trails) to modify the logical topology or by
            employing some other load redistribution mechanisms.
