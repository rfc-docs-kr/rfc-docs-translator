      TransitCapability
          This parameter indicates whether the area can carry data traffic
          that neither originates nor terminates in the area itself. This
          parameter is calculated when the area's shortest-path tree is
          built (see Section 16.1, where TransitCapability is set to TRUE
          if and only if there are one or more fully adjacent virtual
          links using the area as Transit area), and is used as an input
          to a subsequent step of the routing table build process (see
          Section 16.3). When an area's TransitCapability is set to TRUE,
          the area is said to be a "transit area".
