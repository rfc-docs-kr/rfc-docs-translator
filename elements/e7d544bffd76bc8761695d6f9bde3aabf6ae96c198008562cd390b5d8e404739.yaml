     Note: In versions of TLS prior to TLS 1.3, this extension was named
     "elliptic_curves" and only contained elliptic curve groups.  See
     [RFC8422] and [RFC7919].  This extension was also used to negotiate
     ECDSA curves.  Signature algorithms are now negotiated independently
     (see Section 4.2.3).

  참고: TLS 1.3 이전 버전의 TLS에서는 이 확장의 이름이 "elliptic_curves"로 지정되었으며 타원 곡선 그룹만 포함되었습니다. [RFC8422] 및 [RFC7919]를 참조하세요. 이 확장은 ECDSA 곡선을 협상하는 데에도 사용되었습니다. 서명 알고리즘은 이제 독립적으로 협상됩니다(섹션 4.2.3 참조).
