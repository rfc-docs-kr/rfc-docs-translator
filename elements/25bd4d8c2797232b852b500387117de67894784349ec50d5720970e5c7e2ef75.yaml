     The reachability test is performed by sending a unicast ARP Request.
     The host MUST set the target protocol address (ar$tpa) to the IPv4
     address of the node being tested, and the sender protocol address
     field (ar$spa) to its own candidate IPv4 address.  The ARP Request
     MUST use the host MAC address as the source, and the test node MAC
     address as the destination.  The host includes its MAC address in the
     sender hardware address field (ar$sha) and sets the target hardware
     address field (ar$tha) to 0.
