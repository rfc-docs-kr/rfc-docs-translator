     If an ASP Up message is received and, internally, the remote ASP is
     in the ASP-ACTIVE state, an ASP Up Ack message is returned, as well
     as an Error message ("Unexpected Message").  In addition, the remote
     ASP state is changed to ASP-INACTIVE in all relevant Application
     Servers, and all registered Routing Keys are considered deregistered.
