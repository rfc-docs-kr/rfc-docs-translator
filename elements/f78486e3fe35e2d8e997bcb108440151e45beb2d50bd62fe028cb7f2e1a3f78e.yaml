           o  If the security/compartment in the segment does not exactly
              match the security/compartment in the TCB, then send a
              reset; any outstanding RECEIVEs and SEND should receive
              "reset" responses.  All segment queues should be flushed.
              Users should also receive an unsolicited general "connection
              reset" signal.  Enter the CLOSED state, delete the TCB, and
              return.
