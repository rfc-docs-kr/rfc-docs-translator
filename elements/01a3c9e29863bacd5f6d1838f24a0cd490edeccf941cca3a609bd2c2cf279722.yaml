     In addition, resources requested from the server for a particular
     connection MUST be automatically released when the connection closes,
     making failure recovery simpler and more robust.  For example, when a
     lock is acquired by a client, the lock persists until either it is
     explicitly released or the server determines that the connection has
     been terminated.  If a connection is terminated while the client
     holds a lock, the server can perform any appropriate recovery.  The
     <lock> operation is further discussed in Section 7.5.
