     session   Each service provided by the NAS to a dial-in user
               constitutes a session, with the beginning of the session
               defined as the point where service is first provided and
               the end of the session defined as the point where service
               is ended.  A user may have multiple sessions in parallel or
               series if the NAS supports that, with each session
               generating a separate start and stop accounting record with
               its own Acct-Session-Id.
