     Any retransmissions of the final response that are received while in
     the "Completed" state MUST cause the ACK to be re-passed to the
     transport layer for retransmission, but the newly received response
     MUST NOT be passed up to the TU.  A retransmission of the response is
     defined as any response which would match the same client transaction
     based on the rules of Section 17.1.3.

  "완료" 상태에 있는 동안 수신된 최종 응답의 재전송으로 인해 ACK가 재전송을 위해 전송 계층으로 재전송되어야 하지만 새로 수신된 응답이 TU까지 전달되어서는 안 됩니다. 응답의 재전송은 섹션 17.1.3의 규칙에 따라 동일한 클라이언트 트랜잭션과 일치하는 모든 응답으로 정의됩니다.
