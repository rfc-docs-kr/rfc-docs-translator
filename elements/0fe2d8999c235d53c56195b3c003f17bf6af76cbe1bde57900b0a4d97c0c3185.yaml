     When the requested Receiver Port is not available (e.g., port in
     use), the Server at the Session-Reflector MAY suggest an alternate
     and available port for this session in the Port field.  The Session-
     Sender either accepts the alternate port, or composes a new Session-
     Request message with suitable parameters.  Otherwise, the Server at
     the Control-Client uses the Accept field to convey other forms of
     session rejection or failure and MUST NOT suggest an alternate port;
     in this case, the Port field MUST be set to zero.
