     o  MSPs SHOULD advertise their Mail Access Servers and Mail
        Submission Servers, using DNS SRV records according to [RFC6186].
        (In addition to making correct configuration easier for MUAs, this
        provides a way by which MUAs can discover when an MSP begins to
        offer TLS-based services.)  Servers supporting TLS SHOULD be
        advertised in preference to cleartext servers (if offered).  In
        addition, servers using Implicit TLS SHOULD be advertised in
        preference to servers supporting STARTTLS (if offered).  (See also
        Section 4.5.)
