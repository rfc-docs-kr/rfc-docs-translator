     Although a Diameter node may have many possible peers with which it
     is able to communicate, it may not be economical to have an
     established connection to all of them.  At a minimum, a Diameter node
     SHOULD have an established connection with two peers per realm, known
     as the primary and secondary peers.  Of course, a node MAY have
     additional connections, if it is deemed necessary.  Typically, all
     messages for a realm are sent to the primary peer but, in the event
     that failover procedures are invoked, any pending requests are sent
     to the secondary peer.  However, implementations are free to load
     balance requests between a set of peers.
