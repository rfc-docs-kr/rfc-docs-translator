          The reasoning behind this change is as follows. When virtual
          links are in use, an intra-area backbone path for one router can
          turn into an inter-area path in a router several hops closer to
          the destination. Hence, intra-area backbone paths and inter-area
          paths must be of equal preference. We can safely compare their
          costs, preferring the path with the smallest cost, due to the
          calculations in Section 16.3.
