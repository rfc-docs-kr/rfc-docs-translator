     There have also been advances in the cryptanalysis of SHA-1.
     Particularly, the results of Wang et al.  [SHA1CRYPT] (which have
     been independently verified by M.  Cochran in his analysis [COCHRAN])
     on using a differential path to find collisions in SHA-1, which
     conclude that the security strength of the SHA-1 hashing algorithm is
     significantly reduced.  However, this reduction is not significant
     enough to warrant the removal of SHA-1 from existing applications,
     but its usage is only recommended for backwards-compatibility
     reasons.

  SHA-1의 암호화 분석에도 발전이 있었습니다. 특히 Wang et al. [SHA1CRYPT](M. Cochran의 분석 [COCHRAN]에서 독립적으로 검증됨)은 SHA-1에서 충돌을 찾기 위해 차등 경로를 사용하는 것에 대해 연구했으며, 이는 SHA-1 해싱 알고리즘의 보안 강도가 크게 감소했다는 결론을 내렸습니다. 그러나 이러한 감소는 기존 애플리케이션에서 SHA-1을 제거할 만큼 충분히 중요하지 않으며 이전 버전과의 호환성을 위해서만 사용이 권장됩니다.
