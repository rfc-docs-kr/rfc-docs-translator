     Completion of an EAP method exchange (phase 1a) supporting key
     derivation results in the derivation of EAP keying material (MSK,
     EMSK, TEKs) known only to the EAP peer (identified by the Peer-Id(s))
     and EAP server (identified by the Server-Id(s)).  Both the EAP peer
     and EAP server know this keying material to be fresh.  The Peer-Id
     and Server-Id are discussed in Sections 1.4, 2.4, and 2.5 as well as
     in Appendix A.  Key freshness is discussed in Sections 3.4, 3.5, and
     5.7.

  키 파생을 지원하는 EAP 방법 교환(1a단계)이 완료되면 EAP 피어(Peer-Id로 식별됨)와 EAP 서버(식별됨)에만 알려진 EAP 키 자료(MSK, EMSK, TEK)가 파생됩니다. 서버 ID별). EAP 피어와 EAP 서버 모두 이 키 입력 자료가 최신임을 알고 있습니다. Peer-Id와 Server-Id는 섹션 1.4, 2.4, 2.5와 부록 A에서 논의됩니다. 주요 최신성은 섹션 3.4, 3.5, 5.7에서 논의됩니다.
