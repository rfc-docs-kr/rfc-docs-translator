           DISCUSSION:
                Using the Limited Broadcast address instead of a Directed
                Broadcast address may improve system robustness.  Problems
                are often caused by machines that do not understand the
                plethora of broadcast addresses (see Section 3.2.1.3), or
                that may have different ideas about which broadcast
                addresses are in use.  The prime example of the latter is
                machines that do not understand subnetting but are
                attached to a subnetted net.  Sending a Subnet Broadcast
                for the connected network will confuse those machines,
                which will see it as a message to some other host.
