     When Diameter is run over SCTP [RFC4960] or DTLS/SCTP [RFC6083],
     which allow connections to span multiple interfaces, hence, multiple
     IP addresses, the Capabilities-Exchange-Answer message MUST contain
     one Host-IP-Address AVP for each potential IP address that MAY be
     locally used when transmitting Diameter messages.
