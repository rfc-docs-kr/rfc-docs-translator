     A digit map is activated whenever a new event descriptor is applied
     to the termination or embedded event descriptor is activated, and
     that event descriptor contains a digit map completion event which
     itself contains a digit map parameter.  Each new activation of a
     digit map begins at step 1 of the above procedure, with a clear
     current dial string.  Any previous contents of the current dial
     string from an earlier activation are lost.
