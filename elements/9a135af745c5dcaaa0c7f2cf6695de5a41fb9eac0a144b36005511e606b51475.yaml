     where {name} is the name of the capability.  Capabilities are often
     referenced in discussions and email using the shorthand :{name}, or
     :{name}:{version} if the capability exists in multiple versions.  For
     example, the foo capability would have the formal name
     "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:foo:1.0" and be called ":foo".
     The shorthand form MUST NOT be used inside the protocol.
