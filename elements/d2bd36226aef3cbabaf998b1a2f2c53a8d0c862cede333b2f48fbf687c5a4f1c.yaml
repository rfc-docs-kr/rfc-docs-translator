     Delegated credentials do not provide any additional form of early
     revocation.  Since it is short-lived, the expiry of the delegated
     credential revokes the credential.  Revocation of the long-term
     private key that signs the delegated credential (from the end-entity
     certificate) also implicitly revokes the delegated credential.
