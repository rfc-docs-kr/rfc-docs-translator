     This section contains a finite state machine that MUST be observed by
     all Diameter implementations.  Each Diameter node MUST follow the
     state machine described below when communicating with each peer.
     Multiple actions are separated by commas, and may continue on
     succeeding lines, as space requires.  Similarly, state and next state
     may also span multiple lines, as space requires.
