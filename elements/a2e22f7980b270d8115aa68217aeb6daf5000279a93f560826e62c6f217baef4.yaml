     A Simple-Response should only be sent in response to an HTTP/0.9
     Simple-Request or if the server only supports the more limited
     HTTP/0.9 protocol. If a client sends an HTTP/1.0 Full-Request and
     receives a response that does not begin with a Status-Line, it should
     assume that the response is a Simple-Response and parse it
     accordingly. Note that the Simple-Response consists only of the
     entity body and is terminated by the server closing the connection.

  Simple-Response는 HTTP/0.9 Simple-Request에 대한 응답으로 또는 서버가 더 제한된 HTTP/0.9 프로토콜만 지원하는 경우에만 전송되어야 합니다. 클라이언트가 HTTP/1.0 전체 요청을 보내고 상태 줄로 시작하지 않는 응답을 받으면 해당 응답이 단순 응답이라고 가정하고 이에 따라 구문 분석해야 합니다. Simple-Response는 엔터티 본문으로만 구성되며 서버가 연결을 닫으면 종료됩니다.
