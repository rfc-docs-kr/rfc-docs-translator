     Some versions of Unix 4.x bsd use a different encapsulation method in
     order to get better network performance with the VAX virtual memory
     architecture.  Consenting systems on the same IEEE 802 network may
     use this format between themselves.  Details of the trailer
     encapsulation method may be found in [9].  However, all hosts must be
     able to communicate using the standard (non-trailer) method.
