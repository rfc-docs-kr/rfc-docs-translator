     The SRH also differs from RH0 in the processing rules to alleviate
     security concerns that led to the deprecation of RH0 [RFC5095].
     First, RPL routers implement a strict source route policy where each
     and every IPv6 hop between the source and destination of the source
     route is specified within the SRH.  Note that the source route may be
     a subset of the path between the actual source and destination and is
     discussed further below.  Second, an SRH is only used between RPL
     routers within a RPL routing domain.  RPL Border Routers, responsible
     for connecting other RPL routing domains and IP domains that use
     other routing protocols, do not allow datagrams already carrying an
     SRH header to enter or exit a RPL routing domain.  Third, a RPL
     router drops datagrams that include multiple addresses assigned to
     any interfaces on that router to avoid forwarding loops.
