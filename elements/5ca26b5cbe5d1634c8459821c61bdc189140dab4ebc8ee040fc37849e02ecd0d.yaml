          Key storage should persist across a system restart, warm or
          cold, to avoid operational issues. In the event that the last
          key associated with an interface expires, it is unacceptable to
          revert to an unauthenticated condition, and not advisable to
          disrupt routing.  Therefore, the router should send a "last
          authentication key expiration" notification to the network
          manager and treat the key as having an infinite lifetime until
          the lifetime is extended, the key is deleted by network
          management, or a new key is configured.
