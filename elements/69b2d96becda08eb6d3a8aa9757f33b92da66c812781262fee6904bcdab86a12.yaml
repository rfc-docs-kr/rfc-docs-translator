     On the peer, once the method completes unsuccessfully (that is,
     either the authenticator sends a failure result indication, or the
     peer decides that it does not want to continue the conversation,
     possibly after sending a failure result indication), the peer MUST
     terminate the conversation and indicate failure to the lower layer.
     The peer MUST silently discard Success packets and MAY silently
     discard Failure packets.  As a result, loss of a Failure packet need
     not result in a timeout.
