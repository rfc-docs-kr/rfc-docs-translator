           3. Encrypt the result using the key, encryption algorithm,
              and algorithm mode specified for the SA and using any
              required cryptographic synchronization data.
                   - If explicit cryptographic synchronization data,
                     e.g., an IV, is indicated, it is input to the
                     encryption algorithm per the algorithm specification
                     and placed in the Payload field.
                   - If implicit cryptographic synchronization data is
                     employed, it is constructed and input to the
                     encryption algorithm as per the algorithm
                     specification.
                   - If integrity is selected, encryption is performed
                     first, before the integrity algorithm is applied, and
                     the encryption does not encompass the ICV field.
                     This order of processing facilitates rapid detection
                     and rejection of replayed or bogus packets by the
                     receiver, prior to decrypting the packet, hence
                     potentially reducing the impact of denial of service
                     (DoS) attacks.  It also allows for the possibility of
                     parallel processing of packets at the receiver, i.e.,
                     decryption can take place in parallel with integrity
                     checking.  Note that because the ICV is not protected
                     by encryption, a keyed integrity algorithm must be
                     employed to compute the ICV.
