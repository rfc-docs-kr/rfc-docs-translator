                          This specification requires correct encoding of
                          the EncryptedPreMasterSecret complete with
                          length bytes.  The resulting PDU is incompatible
                          with many SSLv3 implementations.  Implementors
                          upgrading from SSLv3 must modify their
                          implementations to generate and accept the
                          correct encoding.  Implementors who wish to be
                          compatible with both SSLv3 and TLS should make
                          their implementation's behavior dependent on the
                          protocol version.
