     This document synthesizes, from experience in the deployment of hosts
     supporting ARP [RFC826], DHCP [RFC2131], and IPv4 Link-Local
     addresses [RFC3927], a set of steps known as Detecting Network
     Attachment for IPv4 (DNAv4).  DNAv4 optimizes the (common) case of
     re-attachment to a network that one has been connected to previously
     by attempting to re-use a previous (but still valid) configuration,
     reducing the re-attachment time on LANs to a few milliseconds.  Since
     this procedure is dependent on the ARP protocol, it is not suitable
     for use on media that do not support ARP.
