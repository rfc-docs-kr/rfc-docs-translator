     Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ([RFC1518], [RFC1519]) is
     deployed in the Internet as the primary mechanism to improve scaling
     property of the Internet routing system. Essential to CIDR is the
     generalization of the concept of variable length subnet masks (VLSM)
     and the elimination of classes of network numbers (A, B, and C). The
     interior (intra-domain) routing protocols that support CIDR are OSPF,
     RIP II, Integrated IS-IS, and E-IGRP.  The exterior (inter-domain)
     routing protocol that supports CIDR is BGP-4.  Protocols like RIP,
     BGP-3, EGP, and IGRP do not support CIDR.
