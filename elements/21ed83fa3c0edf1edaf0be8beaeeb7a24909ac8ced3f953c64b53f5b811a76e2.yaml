     Speech Recognizer
                    A full speech recognition resource that is capable of
                    receiving a media stream containing audio and
                    interpreting it to recognition results.  It also has a
                    natural language semantic interpreter to post-process
                    the recognized data according to the semantic data in
                    the grammar and provide semantic results along with
                    the recognized input.  The recognizer MAY also support
                    enrolled grammars, where the client can enroll and
                    create new personal grammars for use in future
                    recognition operations.
