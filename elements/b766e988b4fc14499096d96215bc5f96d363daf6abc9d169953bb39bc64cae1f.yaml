                   Some environments require the Security option in every
                   datagram; such a requirement is outside the scope of
                   this document and the IP standard specification.  Note,
                   however, that the security options described in RFC-791
                   and RFC-1038 are obsolete.  For DoD applications,
                   vendors should consult [IP:8] for guidance.
