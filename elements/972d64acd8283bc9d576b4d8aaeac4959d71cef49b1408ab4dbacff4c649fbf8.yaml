     Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is a networking concept that
     arose from the desire to align the operation model of a network with
     the model of its typical use.  For TCP/IP networks, this implies
     changing the mechanisms of data access and transport from a host-to-
     host model to a user-to-information model.  The premise is that the
     effort invested in changing models will be offset, or even surpassed,
     by the potential of a "better" network.  However, such a claim can be
     validated only if it is quantified.
