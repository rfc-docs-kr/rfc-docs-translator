        In addition to forwarding requests and responses, proxies make
        policy decisions relating to resource usage and provisioning.
        Typically, this is accomplished by tracking the state of NAS
        devices.  While proxies usually do not respond to client requests
        prior to receiving a response from the server, they may originate
        Reject messages in cases where policies are violated.  As a
        result, proxies need to understand the semantics of the messages
        passing through them, and they may not support all Diameter
        applications.
