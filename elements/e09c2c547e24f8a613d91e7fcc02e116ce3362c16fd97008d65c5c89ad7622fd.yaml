     In normal operation, the Virtual MG will be instructed by the MGC to
     create network flows (if it is the originating side), or to expect
     flow requests (if it is the terminating side), and no confusion will
     arise.  However, if an unexpected event occurs, the Virtual MG must
     know what to do with respect to the physical resources it is
     controlling.
