        ISAKMP negotiations are conducted in two "phases":
        -  "Phase 1 negotiation". A phase 1 negotiation establishes a
           security association to be used by ISAKMP to protect its own
           protocol operations.
        -  "Phase 2 negotiation". A phase 2 negotiation (which is
           protected by a security association that was established by a
           phase 1 negotiation) establishes a security association to be
           used to protect the operations of a protocol other than ISAKMP,
           such as ESP.

  - ISAKMP 협상은 두 가지 "단계"로 진행됩니다. - "1단계 협상". 1단계 협상에서는 자체 프로토콜 작업을 보호하기 위해 ISAKMP에서 사용할 보안 연결을 설정합니다. - "2단계 협상". 2단계 협상(1단계 협상에 의해 설정된 보안 연결로 보호됨)은 ESP와 같은 ISAKMP 이외의 프로토콜 작업을 보호하는 데 사용되는 보안 연결을 설정합니다.
