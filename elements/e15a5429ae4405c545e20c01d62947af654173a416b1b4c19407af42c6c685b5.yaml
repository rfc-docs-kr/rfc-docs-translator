  -- Dual Leaky Bucket algorithm, specify their rates using multiple
  -- Maximum Rate Parameter Entries with the same diffServMaxRateId but
  -- different diffServMaxRateLevels.
  --
  -- The diffServMaxRateLevel/Abs/Rel attributes are used as
  -- parameters to the non-work-conserving portion of a scheduler:
  -- non-work-conserving implies that the scheduler may sometimes not
  -- emit a packet, even if there is data available at its input(s).
  -- This has the effect of limiting the servicing of the queue/scheduler
  -- input or output, in effect performing shaping of the packet stream
  -- passing through the queue/scheduler, as described in the Informal
  -- Differentiated Services Model section 7.2.
