     The ChaCha state does not have four integer numbers: it has 16.  So
     the quarter-round operation works on only four of them -- hence the
     name.  Each quarter round operates on four predetermined numbers in
     the ChaCha state.  We will denote by QUARTERROUND(x,y,z,w) a quarter-
     round operation on the numbers at indices x, y, z, and w of the
     ChaCha state when viewed as a vector.  For example, if we apply
     QUARTERROUND(1,5,9,13) to a state, this means running the quarter-
     round operation on the elements marked with an asterisk, while
     leaving the others alone:
