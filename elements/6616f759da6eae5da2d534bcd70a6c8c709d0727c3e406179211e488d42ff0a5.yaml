     The main threat in ICE is hijacking of connections for the purposes
     of directing media streams to denial-of-service (DoS) targets or to
     malicious users.  When full implementations are used, ICE TCP
     prevents that by only using TCP connections that have been validated.
     Validation requires a STUN transaction to take place over the
     connection.  This transaction cannot complete without both
     participants knowing a shared secret exchanged in the rendezvous
     protocol used with ICE, such as SIP [RFC3261].  This shared secret,
     in turn, is protected by that protocol exchange.  In the case of SIP,
     the usage of the SIP Secure (SIPS) [RFC3261] mechanism is
     RECOMMENDED.  When this is done, an attacker, even if it knows or can
     guess the port on which an agent is listening for incoming TCP
     connections, will not be able to open a connection and send media to
     the agent.
