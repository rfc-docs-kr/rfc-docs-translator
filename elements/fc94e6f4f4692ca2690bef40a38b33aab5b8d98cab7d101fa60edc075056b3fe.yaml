     The CIDR architecture is applicable to any group of connected domains
     that supports IP version 4 [6] [7].  CIDR does not require all of the
     domains in the Internet to be converted to use CIDR. It assumes that
     some of the existing domains in the Internet will never be able to
     convert.  Despite this, CIDR will still provide connectivity to such
     places, although the optimality of routes to these places may be
     impacted.
