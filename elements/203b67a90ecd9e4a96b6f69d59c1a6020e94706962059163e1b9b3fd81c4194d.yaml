     After receiving a 220 response to a STARTTLS command, the client MUST
     start the TLS negotiation before giving any other SMTP commands.  If,
     after having issued the STARTTLS command, the client finds out that
     some failure prevents it from actually starting a TLS handshake, then
     it SHOULD abort the connection.
