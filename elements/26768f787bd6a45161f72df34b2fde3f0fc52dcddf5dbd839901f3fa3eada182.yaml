          OSPF routing packets (with the exception of Hellos) are sent
          only over adjacencies.  This means that all OSPF protocol
          packets travel a single IP hop, except those that are sent over
          virtual adjacencies.  The IP source address of an OSPF protocol
          packet is one end of a router adjacency, and the IP destination
          address is either the other end of the adjacency or an IP
          multicast address.
