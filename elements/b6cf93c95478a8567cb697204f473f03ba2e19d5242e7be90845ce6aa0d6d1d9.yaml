     The TerminationID specifies the termination to be added to the
     Context.  The Termination is either created, or taken from the null
     Context.  For an existing Termination, the TerminationID would be
     specific.  For a Termination that does not yet exist, the
     TerminationID is specified as CHOOSE in the command. The new
     TerminationID will be returned.  Wildcards may be used in an Add, but
     such usage would be unusual.  If the wildcard matches more than one
     TerminationID, all possible matches are attempted, with results
     reported for each one.  The order of attempts when multiple
     TerminationIDs match is not specified.
