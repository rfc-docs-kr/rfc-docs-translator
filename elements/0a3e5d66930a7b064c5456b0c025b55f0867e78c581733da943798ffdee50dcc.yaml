     Relaying protocols capable of relaying TCP connections include TURN
     TCP [RFC6062] and SOCKS [RFC1928] (which can also be used for IPv4-
     IPv6 gatewaying [RFC3089]).  It is also possible to use a Secure
     SHell (SSH) [RFC4251] tunnel as a relayed candidate if a suitable
     server is available and the server permits this.
