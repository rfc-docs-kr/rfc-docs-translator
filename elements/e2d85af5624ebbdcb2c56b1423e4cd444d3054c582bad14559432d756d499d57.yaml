        Another significant transition difficulty is the establishment of
        appropriate addressing authorities.  In order not to delay the
        deployment of this addressing scheme, if no authority has been
        created at an appropriate level, a higher level authority may
        allocated addresses instead of the lower level authority.  For
        example, suppose that the continental authority has been allocated
        a portion of the address space and that the service providers
        present on that continent are clear, but have not yet established
        their addressing authority.  The continental authority may foresee
        (possibly with information from the provider) that the provider
        will eventually create an authority.  The continental authority
        may then act on behalf of that provider until the provider is
        prepared to assume its addressing authority duties.
