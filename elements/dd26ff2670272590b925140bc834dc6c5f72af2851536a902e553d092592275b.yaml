     -  The Session-Receiver is called the Session-Reflector in the TWAMP
        architecture.  The Session-Reflector has the capability to create
        and send a measurement packet when it receives a measurement
        packet.  Unlike the Session-Receiver, the Session-Reflector does
        not collect any packet information.
