     The basic Internet routing components are service providers (e.g.,
     backbones, regional networks), and service subscribers (e.g., sites
     or campuses).  These components are arranged hierarchically for the
     most part.  A natural mapping from these components to IP routing
     components is that providers and subscribers act as routing domains.
