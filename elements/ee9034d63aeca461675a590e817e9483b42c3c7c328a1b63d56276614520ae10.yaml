     The allowed values for the mode property are send-only, receive-only,
     send/receive, inactive and loop-back.  "Send" and "receive" are with
     respect to the exterior of the context, so that, for example, a
     stream set to mode=sendonly does not pass received media into the
     context.  Signals and Events are not affected by mode.
