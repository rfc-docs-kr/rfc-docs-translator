          Timers
              Two different kind of timers are required.  The first kind,
              called "single shot timers", fire once and cause a protocol
              event to be processed.  The second kind, called "interval
              timers", fire at continuous intervals.  These are used for
              the sending of packets at regular intervals.  A good example
              of this is the regular broadcast of Hello packets. The
              granularity of both kinds of timers is one second.
