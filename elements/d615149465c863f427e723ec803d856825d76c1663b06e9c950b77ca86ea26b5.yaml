     When CIDR was first proposed in the early 1990s, the original authors
     made some observations about the growth rate of global routing state
     and offered projections on how CIDR deployment would, hopefully,
     reduce what appeared to be exponential growth to a more sustainable
     rate.  Since that deployment, an ongoing effort, called "The CIDR
     Report" [CRPT], has attempted to quantify and track that growth rate.
     What follows is a brief summary of the CIDR report as of March 2005,
     with an attempt to explain the various patterns and changes of growth
     rate that have occurred since measurements of the size of global
     routing state began in 1988.
