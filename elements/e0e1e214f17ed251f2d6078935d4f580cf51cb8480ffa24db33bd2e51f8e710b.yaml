     Since the Identifier is only a single octet, it is easy to guess,
     allowing an attacker to successfully inject or replay EAP packets.
     An attacker may also modify EAP headers (Code, Identifier, Length,
     Type) within EAP packets where the header is unprotected.  This could
     cause packets to be inappropriately discarded or misinterpreted.
