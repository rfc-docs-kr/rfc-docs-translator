     There are two aspects of interest when discussing IP address
     allocation within the Internet. The first is the set of
     administrative requirements for obtaining and allocating IP
     addresses; the second is the technical aspect of such assignments,
     having largely to do with routing, both within a routing domain
     (intra-domain routing) and between routing domains (inter-domain
     routing). This paper focuses on the technical issues.
