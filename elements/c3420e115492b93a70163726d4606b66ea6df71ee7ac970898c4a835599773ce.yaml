                   A delayed ACK gives the application an opportunity to
                   update the window and perhaps to send an immediate
                   response.  In particular, in the case of character-mode
                   remote login, a delayed ACK can reduce the number of
                   segments sent by the server by a factor of 3 (ACK,
                   window update, and echo character all combined in one
                   segment).
