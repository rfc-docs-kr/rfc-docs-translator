                (a)  In general, no host is required to accept an IP
                     datagram larger than 576 bytes (including header and
                     data), so a host must not send a larger datagram
                     without explicit knowledge or prior arrangement with
                     the destination host.  Thus, MMS_S is only an upper
                     bound on the datagram size that a transport protocol
                     may send; even when MMS_S exceeds 556, the transport
                     layer must limit its messages to 556 bytes in the
                     absence of other knowledge about the destination
                     host.
