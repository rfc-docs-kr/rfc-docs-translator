     The interim AH interim scheme does not provide protection against
     eavesdropping; thus forbidding third parties from monitoring the
     connections set up by a given termination. Also, it does not provide
     protection against replay attacks.  These procedures do not
     necessarily protect against denial of service attacks by misbehaving
     MGs or misbehaving MGCs. However, they will provide an identification
     of these misbehaving entities, which should then be deprived of their
     authorization through maintenance procedures.
