     Normally, all communication is performed using 802.2 type 1
     communication.  Consenting systems on the same IEEE 802 network may
     use 802.2 type 2 communication after verifying that it is supported
     by both nodes.  This is accomplished using the 802.2 XID mechanism.
     However, type 1 communication is the recommended method at this time
     and must be supported by all implementations.  The rest of this
     specification assumes the use of type 1 communication.
