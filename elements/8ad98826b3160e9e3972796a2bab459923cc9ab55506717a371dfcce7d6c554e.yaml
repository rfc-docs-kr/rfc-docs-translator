     Terminations may have signals applied to them.  Signals are MG
     generated media streams such as tones and announcements as well as
     line signals such as hookswitch.  Terminations may be programmed to
     detect Events, the occurrence of which can trigger notification
     messages to the MGC, or action by the MG.  Statistics may be
     accumulated on a Termination.  Statistics are reported to the MGC
     upon request (by means of the AuditValue command, see section 7.2.5)
     and when the Termination is taken out of the call it is in.
