     To maximize interoperability among hardware-based codecs, we assume
     the sequential DCT operating mode [1,Annex F] and restrict the set of
     predefined RTP/JPEG "type codes" (defined below) to single-scan,
     interleaved images.  While this is more restrictive than even
     baseline JPEG, many hardware implementation fall short of the
     baseline specification (e.g., most hardware cannot decode non-
     interleaved scans).
