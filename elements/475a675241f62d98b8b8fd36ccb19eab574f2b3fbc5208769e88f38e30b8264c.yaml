      Five bits of the OSPF Options field have been assigned, although
      only one (the E-bit) is described completely by this memo. Each bit
      is described briefly below. Routers should reset (i.e.  clear)
      unrecognized bits in the Options field when sending Hello packets or
      Database Description packets and when originating LSAs. Conversely,
      routers encountering unrecognized Option bits in received Hello
      Packets, Database Description packets or LSAs should ignore the
      capability and process the packet/LSA normally.
