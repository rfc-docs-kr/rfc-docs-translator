        Say, a host on private network initiated a multicast session.
        Datagram sent by the private host could trigger responses in the
        reverse direction from multiple external hosts. Traditional-NAT
        implementations that use a single state to track a multicast
        session cannot determine for certain if the incoming UDP packet
        is in response to an existing multicast session or the start of
        new UDP session initiated by an attacker.
