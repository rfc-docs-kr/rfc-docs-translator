     An important consideration in the evaluation of any kind of future
     Internet mechanism lies in the characteristics of that evaluation
     itself.  Central to the assessment of the features provided by a
     novel mechanism is the consideration of how it improves over already
     existing technologies, and by "how much".  With the disruptive nature
     of clean-slate approaches generating new and different technological
     requirements, it is complex to provide meaningful results for a
     network-layer framework, in comparison with what is deployed in the
     current Internet.  Thus, despite the availability of ICN
     implementations and simulators, the need for large-scale environments
     supporting experimental evaluation of novel research is of prime
     importance to the advancement of ICN deployment.
