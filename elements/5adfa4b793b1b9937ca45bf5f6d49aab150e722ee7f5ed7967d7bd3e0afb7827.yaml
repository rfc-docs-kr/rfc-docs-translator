     As detailed in Section 4, the delegated credential is
     cryptographically bound to the end-entity certificate with which the
     credential may be used.  This document specifies the use of delegated
     credentials in (D)TLS 1.3 or later; their use in prior versions of
     the protocol is not allowed.
