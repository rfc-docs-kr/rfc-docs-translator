     RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
     are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
     specification [6], and any appropriate RTP profile (for example [7]).
     This implies that confidentiality of the media streams is achieved by
     encryption. Because the data compression used with this payload
     format is applied end-to-end, encryption may be performed after
     compression so there is no conflict between the two operations.
