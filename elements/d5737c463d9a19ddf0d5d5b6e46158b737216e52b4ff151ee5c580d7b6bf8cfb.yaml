     o  Section 5 on EAP Request/Response Types lists two new Type values:
        the Expanded Type (Section 5.7), which is used to expand the Type
        value number space, and the Experimental Type.  In the Expanded
        Type number space, the new Expanded Nak (Section 5.3.2) Type has
        been added.  Clarifications have been made in the description of
        most of the existing Types.  Security claims summaries have been
        added for authentication methods.
