     An implementation that wants to remain compatible with IMAP4rev1 can
     advertise both IMAP4rev1 and IMAP4rev2 in its CAPABILITY response /
     response code.  (Such server implementation is likely to also want to
     advertise other IMAP4rev1 extensions that were folded into IMAP4rev2;
     see Appendix E.)  While some IMAP4rev1 responses were removed in
     IMAP4rev2, their presence will not break IMAP4rev2-only clients.

  IMAP4rev1과의 호환성을 유지하려는 구현은 CAPABILITY 응답/응답 코드에서 IMAP4rev1 및 IMAP4rev2를 모두 광고할 수 있습니다.  (이러한 서버 구현은 IMAP4rev2로 접힌 다른 IMAP4rev1 확장도 광고하려고 할 가능성이 높습니다. 부록 E를 참조하십시오.) 일부 IMAP4rev1 응답은 IMAP4rev2에서 제거되었지만 해당 응답이 있어도 IMAP4rev2 전용 클라이언트는 중단되지 않습니다.
