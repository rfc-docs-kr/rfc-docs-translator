     If a SPEAK request is active with kill-on-barge-in enabled (see
     Section 8.4.2), and the BARGE-IN-OCCURRED event is received, the
     synthesizer MUST immediately stop streaming out audio.  It MUST also
     terminate any speech requests queued behind the current active one,
     irrespective of whether or not they have barge-in enabled.  If a
     barge-in-able SPEAK request was playing and it was terminated, the
     response MUST contain an Active-Request-Id-List header field listing
     the request-ids of all SPEAK requests that were terminated.  The
     server generates no SPEAK-COMPLETE events for these requests.

  SPEAK 요청이 kill-on-barge-in이 활성화된 상태에서 활성화되고(8.4.2절 참조) BARGE-IN-OCCURRED 이벤트가 수신되면 신디사이저는 즉시 오디오 스트리밍을 중지해야 합니다. 또한 현재 활성화된 요청 뒤에 대기 중인 모든 음성 요청을 종료해야 합니다. barge-in이 활성화되었는지 여부와 관계없이요. barge-in 가능한 SPEAK 요청이 재생 중이었고 종료된 경우 응답에는 종료된 모든 SPEAK 요청의 요청 ID를 나열하는 Active-Request-Id-List 헤더 필드가 포함되어야 합니다. 서버는 이러한 요청에 대해 SPEAK-COMPLETE 이벤트를 생성하지 않습니다.
