           The Transmission Control Protocol TCP [TCP:1] is the primary
           virtual-circuit transport protocol for the Internet suite.  TCP
           provides reliable, in-sequence delivery of a full-duplex stream
           of octets (8-bit bytes).  TCP is used by those applications
           needing reliable, connection-oriented transport service, e.g.,
           mail (SMTP), file transfer (FTP), and virtual terminal service
           (Telnet); requirements for these application-layer protocols
           are described in [INTRO:1].
