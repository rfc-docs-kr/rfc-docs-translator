                   (2)  Unicast Poll -- Actively poll the remote host by
                        periodically sending a point-to-point ARP Request
                        to it, and delete the entry if no ARP Reply is
                        received from N successive polls.  Again, the
                        timeout should be on the order of a minute, and
                        typically N is 2.
