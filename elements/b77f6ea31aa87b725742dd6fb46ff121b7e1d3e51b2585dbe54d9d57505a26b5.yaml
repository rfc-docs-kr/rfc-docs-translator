      Designated Router
          The Designated Router selected for the attached network.  The
          Designated Router is selected on all broadcast and NBMA networks
          by the Hello Protocol.  Two pieces of identification are kept
          for the Designated Router: its Router ID and its IP interface
          address on the network.  The Designated Router advertises link
          state for the network; this network-LSA is labelled with the
          Designated Router's IP address.  The Designated Router is
          initialized to 0.0.0.0, which indicates the lack of a Designated
          Router.
