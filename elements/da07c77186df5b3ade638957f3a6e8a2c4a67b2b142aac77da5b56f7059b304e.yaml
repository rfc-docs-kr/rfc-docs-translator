     The AVP Code numbering space of all AVPs included in a Grouped AVP is
     the same as for non-Grouped AVPs.  Receivers of a Grouped AVP that
     does not have the 'M' (mandatory) bit set and one or more of the
     encapsulated AVPs within the group has the 'M' (mandatory) bit set
     MAY simply be ignored if the Grouped AVP itself is unrecognized.  The
     rule applies even if the encapsulated AVP with its 'M' (mandatory)
     bit set is further encapsulated within other sub-groups, i.e., other
     Grouped AVPs embedded within the Grouped AVP.
