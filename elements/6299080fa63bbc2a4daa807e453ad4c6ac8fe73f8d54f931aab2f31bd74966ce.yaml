          Link state advertisement
              Unit of data describing the local state of a router or
              network. For a router, this includes the state of the
              router's interfaces and adjacencies.  Each link state
              advertisement is flooded throughout the routing domain. The
              collected link state advertisements of all routers and
              networks forms the protocol's link state database.
              Throughout this memo, link state advertisement is
              abbreviated as LSA.
