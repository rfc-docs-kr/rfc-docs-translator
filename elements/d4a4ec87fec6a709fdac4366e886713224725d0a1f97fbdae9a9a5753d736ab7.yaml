     In the state table, the event "Failure to send" means that the
     Diameter client is unable to communicate with the desired
     destination.  This could be due to the peer being down, or due to the

     notification DIAMETER_OUT_OF_SPACE, DIAMETER_TOO_BUSY, or
     DIAMETER_LOOP_DETECTED in the Result-Code AVP of the Accounting
