     With the structures of this MIB divided into data path linkage tables
     and parameterization tables, and with the use of RowPointer, new data
     path linkage and parameterization tables can be defined in other MIB
     modules, and used with tables defined in this MIB.  This MIB does not
     limit the type of entries its RowPointer attributes can point to,
     hence new functional data path elements can be defined in other MIBs
     and integrated with functional data path elements of this MIB.  For
     example, new Action functional data path element can be defined for
     Traffic Engineering and be integrated with Differentiated Services
     functional data path elements, possibly used within the same data
     path sharing the same classifiers and meters.
