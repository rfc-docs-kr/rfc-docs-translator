     Since the local network layer can always map an IP address into data
     link layer address, the choice of an IP "broadcast host number" is
     somewhat arbitrary.  For simplicity, it should be one not likely to
     be assigned to a real host.  The number whose bits are all ones has
     this property; this assignment was first proposed in [6].  In the few
     cases where a host has been assigned an address with a host-number
     part of all ones, it does not seem onerous to require renumbering.
