     the IPv6 Destination Address field of the packet carrying the SRH.
     The CmprI and CmprE fields indicate the number of prefix octets that
     are shared with the IPv6 Destination Address of the packet carrying
     the SRH.  The shared prefix octets are not carried within the Routing
     header and each entry in Address[1..n-1] has size (16 - CmprI) octets
     and Address[n] has size (16 - CmprE) octets.  When CmprI or CmprE is
     non-zero, there may exist unused octets between the last entry,
     Address[n], and the end of the Routing header.  The Pad field
     indicates the number of unused octets that are used for padding.
     Note that when CmprI and CmprE are both 0, Pad MUST carry a value of
     0.
