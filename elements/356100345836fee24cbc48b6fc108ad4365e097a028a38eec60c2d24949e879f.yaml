        The Vendor-ID field is present if the 'V' bit is set in the AVP
        Flags field.  The optional four-octet Vendor-ID field contains the
        IANA-assigned "SMI Network Management Private Enterprise Codes"
        [ENTERPRISE] value, encoded in network byte order.  Any vendors or
        standardization organizations that are also treated like vendors
        in the IANA-managed "SMI Network Management Private Enterprise
        Codes" space wishing to implement a vendor-specific Diameter AVP
        MUST use their own Vendor-ID along with their privately managed
        AVP address space, guaranteeing that they will not collide with
        any other vendor's vendor-specific AVP(s) or with future IETF
        AVPs.
