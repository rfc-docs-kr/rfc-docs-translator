     Obtaining server reflexive passive candidates may require initiating
     connections from host's passive candidates; see Appendix B for
     implementation details on this.  Server reflexive active candidates
     can be derived from passive or S-O candidates by using the same IP
     addresses and interfaces as those candidates.  It is useful to obtain
     both server reflexive passive and S-O candidates since which one
     actually works better depends on the hosts and NATs.  Furthermore,
     some techniques (e.g., TURN relaying) require knowing the IP address
     of the peer's active candidates beforehand, so active server
     reflexive candidates are needed for such techniques to function
     properly.
