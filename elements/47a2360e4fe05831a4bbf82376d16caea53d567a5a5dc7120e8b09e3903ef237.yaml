          In a link-state routing algorithm, it is very important for all
          routers' link-state databases to stay synchronized.  OSPF
          simplifies this by requiring only adjacent routers to remain
          synchronized.  The synchronization process begins as soon as the
          routers attempt to bring up the adjacency.  Each router
          describes its database by sending a sequence of Database
          Description packets to its neighbor.  Each Database Description
          Packet describes a set of LSAs belonging to the router's
          database.  When the neighbor sees an LSA that is more recent
          than its own database copy, it makes a note that this newer LSA
          should be requested.
