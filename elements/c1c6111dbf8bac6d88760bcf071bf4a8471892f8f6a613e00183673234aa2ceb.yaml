     During the TLS negotiation [TLS-1.3] [TLS-1.2], the client MUST check
     its understanding of the server hostname against the server's
     identity as presented in the server Certificate message, in order to
     prevent on-path attackers attempting to masquerade as the server.
     This procedure is described in [RFC7817].
