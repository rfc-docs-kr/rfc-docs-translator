     Note that if the network provider uses an IGP which can support
     classless networks, he can (but doesn't have to) perform
     "supernetting" at the point where he connects to his clients and
     therefore only maintain six distinct routes for the 36 class C
     network numbers. If not, explicit routes to all 36 class C networks
     will have to be carried by the IGP.
