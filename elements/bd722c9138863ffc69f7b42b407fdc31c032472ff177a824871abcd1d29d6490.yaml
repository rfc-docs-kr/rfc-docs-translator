     This plan is primarily directed at the first two problems listed
     above.  We believe that the judicious use of variable-length
     subnetting techniques should help defer the onset of the last problem
     problem, the exhaustion of the 32-bit address space. Note also that
     improved tools for performing address allocation in a "supernetted"
     and variably-subnetted world would greatly help the user community in
     accepting these sometimes confusing techniques. Efforts to create
     some simple tools for this purpose should be encouraged by the
     Internet community.
