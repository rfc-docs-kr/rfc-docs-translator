     Transition of users from SSL or TLS 1.0 to later versions of TLS MAY
     be accomplished by a means similar to that described above.  There
     are multiple ways to accomplish this.  One way is for the server to
     refuse a ClientHello message from any client sending a
     ClientHello.version field corresponding to any version of SSL or
     TLS 1.0.  Another way is for the server to accept ClientHello
     messages from some client versions that it does not wish to support
     but later refuse to allow the user to authenticate.  The latter
     method may provide a better indication to the user of the reason for
     the failure but (depending on the protocol and method of
     authentication used) may also risk exposure of the user's password
     over a channel that is known to not provide adequate confidentiality.
