     The type code determines whether restart markers are present.  If a
     type supports restart markers, the packet MUST contain a non-zero
     Restart Interval value in a Restart Marker Header and restart markers
     MUST appear on byte aligned boundaries beginning with an 0xFF between
     MCUs at that interval.  Additional 0xFF bytes MAY appear between
     restart intervals.  This can be used in the packetization process to
     align data to something like a word boundary for more efficient
     copying.  Restart markers MUST NOT appear anywhere else in the JPEG
     payload.  Types which do not support restart makers MUST NOT contain
     restart markers anywhere in the JPEG payload. All packets MUST
     contain a "stuffed" 0x00 byte following any true 0xFF byte generated
     by the entropy coder [1, Sec.  B.1.1.5].
