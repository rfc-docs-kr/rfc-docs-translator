     Access could be limited by encrypting the content, but the necessity
     of distributing keys out-of-band appears to negate the advantages of
     in-network caching.  This also creates significant challenges when
     attempting to manage and restrict key access.  An authorization
     delegation scheme has been proposed [Fotiou12].  This scheme allows
     semi-trusted entities (such as caches or CDN nodes) to delegate
     access control decisions to third-party access control providers that
     are trusted by the content publisher.  The former entities have no
     access to subscriber-related information and should respect the
     decisions of the access control providers.
