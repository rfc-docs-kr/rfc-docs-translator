         Typically, the EAP peer obtains information on the EAP MTU from
         the lower layers and sets the EAP frame size to an appropriate
         value.  Where the authenticator operates in pass-through mode,
         the authentication server does not have a direct way of
         determining the EAP MTU, and therefore relies on the
         authenticator to provide it with this information, such as via
         the Framed-MTU attribute, as described in [RFC3579], Section 2.4.
