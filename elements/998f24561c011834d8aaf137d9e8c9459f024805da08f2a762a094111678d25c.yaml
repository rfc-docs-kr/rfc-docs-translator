                   Some applications (e.g., SMTP servers) may need to
                   handle multiple connection attempts at about the same
                   time.  The probability of a connection attempt failing
                   is reduced by giving the application some means of
                   listening for a new connection at the same time that an
                   earlier connection attempt is going through the three-
                   way handshake.
