     A number of conceptual tables defined in this MIB use as an index an
     arbitrary integer value, unique across the scope of the agent.  In
     order to help with multi-manager row-creation problems, a mechanism
     must be provided to allow a manager to obtain unique values for such
     an index and to ensure that, when used, the manager knows whether it
     got what it wanted or not.
