          chosen, regardless of the internal distance to the AS boundary
          router.  Suppose in our example both Router RT5 and Router RT7
          were advertising Type 2 external routes.  Then all traffic
          destined for Network N12 would be forwarded to Router RT7, since
          2 < 8.  When several equal-cost Type 2 routes exist, the
          internal distance to the advertising routers is used to break
          the tie.
