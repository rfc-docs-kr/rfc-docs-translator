      A router that sends a Link State Request packet has in mind the
      precise instance of the database pieces it is requesting. Each
      instance is defined by its LS sequence number, LS checksum, and LS
      age, although these fields are not specified in the Link State
      Request Packet itself.  The router may receive even more recent
      instances in response.
