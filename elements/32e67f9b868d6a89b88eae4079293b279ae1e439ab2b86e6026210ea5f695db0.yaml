              As an example, suppose an IP subnetted network is to be its
              own OSPF area.  The area would be configured as a single
              address range, whose IP address is the address of the
              subnetted network, and whose mask is the natural class A, B,
              or C address mask.  A single route would be advertised
              external to the area, describing the entire subnetted
              network.
