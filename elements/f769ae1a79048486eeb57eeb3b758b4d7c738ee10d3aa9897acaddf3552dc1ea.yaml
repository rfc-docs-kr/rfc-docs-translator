                  If an area is capable of carrying transit traffic (i.e.,
                  its TransitCapability is set to TRUE), routing
                  information concerning backbone networks should not be
                  condensed before being summarized into the area.  Nor
                  should the advertisement of backbone networks into
                  transit areas be suppressed.  In other words, the
                  backbone's configured ranges should be ignored when
                  originating summary-LSAs into transit areas.
