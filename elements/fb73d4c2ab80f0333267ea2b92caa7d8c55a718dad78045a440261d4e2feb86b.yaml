     Connection establishment of TWAMP follows the same procedure defined
     in Section 3.1 of OWAMP [RFC4656].  The Modes field is a recognized
     extension mechanism in TWAMP, and the current mode values are
     identical to those used in OWAMP.  The only exception is the well-
     known port number for TWAMP-Control.  A Client opens a TCP connection
     to the Server on well-known port 862.  The host that initiates the
     TCP connection takes the roles of Control-Client and (in the two-host
     implementation) the Session-Sender.  The host that acknowledges the
     TCP connection accepts the roles of Server and (in the two-host
     implementation) the Session-Reflector.
