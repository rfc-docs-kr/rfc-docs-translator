     When a transport failure is detected, if possible, all messages in
     the queue are sent to an alternate agent with the T flag set.  On
     booting a Diameter client or agent, the T flag is also set on any
     remaining records in non-volatile storage that are still waiting to
     be transmitted.  An example of a case where it is not possible to
     forward the message to an alternate server is when the message has a
     fixed destination, and the unavailable peer is the message's final
     destination (see Destination-Host AVP).  Such an error requires that
     the agent return an answer message with the 'E' bit set and the
     Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER.
