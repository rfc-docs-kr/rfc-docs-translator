     When two Diameter peers establish a transport connection, they MUST
     exchange the Capabilities Exchange messages, as specified in the peer
     state machine (see Section 5.6).  This message allows the discovery
     of a peer's identity and its capabilities (protocol version number,
     the identifiers of supported Diameter applications, security
     mechanisms, etc.).
