        An Interim Accounting Record contains cumulative accounting
        information for an existing accounting session.  Interim
        Accounting Records SHOULD be sent every time a re-authentication
        or re-authorization occurs.  Further, additional interim record
        triggers MAY be defined by application-specific Diameter
        applications.  The selection of whether to use INTERIM_RECORD
        records is done by the Acct-Interim-Interval AVP.
