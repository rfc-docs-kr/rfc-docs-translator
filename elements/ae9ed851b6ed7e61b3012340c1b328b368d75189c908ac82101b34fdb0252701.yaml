     An endpoint that receives a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame with a sequence
     number smaller than the Retire Prior To field of a previously
     received NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame MUST send a corresponding
     RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame that retires the newly received connection
     ID, unless it has already done so for that sequence number.

  이전에 수신된 NEW_CONNECTION_ID 프레임의 Retire Prior To 필드보다 작은 시퀀스 번호를 가진 NEW_CONNECTION_ID 프레임을 수신하는 엔드포인트는 해당 시퀀스 번호에 대해 이미 그렇게 하지 않은 한 새로 수신된 연결 ID를 폐기하는 해당 RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID 프레임을 보내야 합니다.
