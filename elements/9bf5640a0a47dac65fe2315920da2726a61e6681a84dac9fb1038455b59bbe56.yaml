         The primary function of this table is to ensure that the value of
         diffServClfrId is unique before attempting to use it in creating
         a diffServClfrElementEntry. Therefore, the diffServClfrEntry must
         be created on the same SET as the diffServClfrElementEntry, or
         before the diffServClfrElementEntry is created."
