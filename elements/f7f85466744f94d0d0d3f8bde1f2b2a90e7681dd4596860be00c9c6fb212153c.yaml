                   Some TCP implementations, however, have included a
                   keep-alive mechanism.  To confirm that an idle
                   connection is still active, these implementations send
                   a probe segment designed to elicit a response from the
                   peer TCP.  Such a segment generally contains SEG.SEQ =
                   SND.NXT-1 and may or may not contain one garbage octet
                   of data.  Note that on a quiet connection SND.NXT =
                   RCV.NXT, so that this SEG.SEQ will be outside the
                   window.  Therefore, the probe causes the receiver to
                   return an acknowledgment segment, confirming that the
                   connection is still live.  If the peer has dropped the
                   connection due to a network partition or a crash, it
                   will respond with a RST instead of an acknowledgment
                   segment.
