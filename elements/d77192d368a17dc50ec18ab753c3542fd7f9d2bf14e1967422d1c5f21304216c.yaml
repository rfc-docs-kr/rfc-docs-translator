     Prior to bringing up a connection, authorization checks are performed
     at each connection along the path.  Diameter capabilities negotiation
     (CER/CEA) also MUST be carried out, in order to determine what
     Diameter applications are supported by each peer.  Diameter sessions
     MUST be routed only through authorized nodes that have advertised
     support for the Diameter application required by the session.
