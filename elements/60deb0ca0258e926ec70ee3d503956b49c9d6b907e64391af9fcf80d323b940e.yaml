     A URI is represented as a sequence of characters, not as a sequence
     of octets. That is because URI might be "transported" by means that
     are not through a computer network, e.g., printed on paper, read over
     the radio, etc.

  URI는 일련의 옥텟이 아닌 일련의 문자로 표시됩니다. 이는 URI가 컴퓨터 네트워크를 통하지 않는 수단(예: 종이에 인쇄되거나 라디오를 통해 읽는 등)을 통해 "전송"될 수 있기 때문입니다.
