           o  In the following it is assumed that the segment is the
              idealized segment that begins at RCV.NXT and does not exceed
              the window.  One could tailor actual segments to fit this
              assumption by trimming off any portions that lie outside the
              window (including SYN and FIN) and only processing further
              if the segment then begins at RCV.NXT.  Segments with higher
              beginning sequence numbers SHOULD be held for later
              processing (SHLD-31).
