     With relayed candidates, the host commonly needs to obtain only a
     passive candidate since any of the peer's server reflexive (and NAT-
     assisted if the peer can communicate with the outermost NAT) active
     candidates should work with the passive relayed candidate.  However,
     if the relay is behind a NAT or a firewall, also using active and S-O
     candidates will increase success probability.
