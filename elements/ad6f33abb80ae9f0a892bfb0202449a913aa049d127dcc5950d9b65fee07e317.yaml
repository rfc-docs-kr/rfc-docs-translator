     The PSK binder value forms a binding between a PSK and the current
     handshake, as well as a binding between the handshake in which the
     PSK was generated (if via a NewSessionTicket message) and the current
     handshake.  Each entry in the binders list is computed as an HMAC
     over a transcript hash (see Section 4.4.1) containing a partial
     ClientHello up to and including the PreSharedKeyExtension.identities
     field.  That is, it includes all of the ClientHello but not the
     binders list itself.  The length fields for the message (including
     the overall length, the length of the extensions block, and the
     length of the "pre_shared_key" extension) are all set as if binders
     of the correct lengths were present.

  PSK 바인더 값은 PSK와 현재 핸드셰이크 간의 바인딩뿐만 아니라 PSK가 생성된 핸드셰이크(NewSessionTicket 메시지를 통한 경우)와 현재 핸드셰이크 간의 바인딩도 형성합니다. 바인더 목록의 각 항목은 PreSharedKeyExtension.identities 필드까지 부분 ClientHello를 포함하는 기록 해시(섹션 4.4.1 참조)에 대한 HMAC로 계산됩니다. 즉, 모든 ClientHello를 포함하지만 바인더 목록 자체는 포함하지 않습니다. 메시지의 길이 필드(전체 길이, 확장 블록의 길이 및 "pre_shared_key" 확장의 길이 포함)는 모두 올바른 길이의 바인더가 있는 것처럼 설정됩니다.
