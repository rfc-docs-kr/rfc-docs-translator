     To be compatible with the existing DNS infrastructure and simplify
     host and domain name comparison, Diameter identities (FQDNs) are
     represented in ASCII form.  This allows the Diameter protocol to fall
     in-line with the DNS strategy of being transparent from the effects
     of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) by following the
     recommendations in [RFC4690] and [RFC5890].  Applications that
     provide support for IDNs outside of the Diameter protocol but
     interacting with it SHOULD use the representation and conversion
     framework described in [RFC5890], [RFC5891], and [RFC3492].
