      Link state request list
          The list of LSAs that need to be received from this neighbor in
          order to synchronize the two neighbors' link-state databases.
          This list is created as Database Description packets are
          received, and is then sent to the neighbor in Link State Request
          packets.  The list is depleted as appropriate Link State Update
          packets are received.
