     An event can include an Embedded Signals descriptor and/or an
     Embedded Events Descriptor which, if present, replaces the current
     Signals/Events descriptor when the event is recognized.  It is
     possible, for example, to specify that the dial-tone Signal be
     generated when an off-hook Event is recognized, or that the dial-tone
     Signal be stopped when a digit is recognized.  A media gateway
     controller shall not send EventsDescriptors with an event both marked
     KeepActive and containing an embedded SignalsDescriptor.
