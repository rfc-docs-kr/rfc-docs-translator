     An attribute that appears in a subtree filter is part of an
     "attribute match expression".  Any number of (unqualified or
     qualified) XML attributes MAY be present in any type of filter node.
     In addition to the selection criteria normally applicable to that
     node, the selected data MUST have matching values for every attribute
     specified in the node.  If an element is not defined to include a
     specified attribute, then it is not selected in the filter output.
