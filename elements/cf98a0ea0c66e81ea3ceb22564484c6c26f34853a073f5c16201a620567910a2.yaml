     There are two classes of multi-device operations.  The first class
     allows the operation to fail on individual devices without requiring
     all devices to revert to their original state.  The operation can be
     retried at a later time, or its failure simply reported to the user.
     An example of this class might be adding an NTP server.  For this
     class of operations, failure avoidance and recovery are focused on
     the individual device.  This means recovery of the device, reporting
     the failure, and perhaps scheduling another attempt.
