     The specific means employed for deprecation of cleartext Mail Access
     Servers and Mail Submission Servers MAY vary from one MSP to the next
     in light of their user communities' needs and constraints.  For
     example, an MSP MAY implement a gradual transition in which, over
     time, more and more users are forbidden to authenticate to cleartext
     instances of these servers, thus encouraging those users to migrate
     to Implicit TLS.  Access to cleartext servers should eventually be
     either (a) disabled or (b) limited strictly for use by legacy systems
     that cannot be upgraded.
