     Resistance to dictionary attack means that the adversary must launch
     an active attack to make a single guess at the pre-shared key.  If
     the size of the pool from which the key was extracted was d and each
     key in the pool has an equal probability of being chosen, then the
     probability of success after a single guess is 1/d.  After x guesses,
     and removal of failed guesses from the pool of possible keys, the
     probability becomes 1/(d-x).  As x grows, so does the probability of
     success.  Therefore, it is possible for an adversary to determine the
     pre-shared key through repeated brute-force, active, guessing
     attacks.  This authentication method does not presume to be secure
     against this, and implementations SHOULD ensure the value of d is
     sufficiently large to prevent this attack.  Implementations SHOULD
     also take countermeasures, for instance, refusing authentication
     attempts for a certain amount of time after the number of failed
     authentication attempts reaches a certain threshold.  No such
     threshold or amount of time is recommended in this memo.

  사전 공격에 대한 저항은 공격자가 사전 공유 키에 대해 단일 추측을 하기 위해 적극적인 공격을 시작해야 함을 의미합니다.  키가 추출된 풀의 크기가 d이고 풀의 각 키가 선택될 확률이 동일한 경우 단일 추측 후 성공 확률은 1/d입니다.  x개의 추측을 하고 가능한 키 풀에서 실패한 추측을 제거한 후 확률은 1/(d-x)가 됩니다.  x가 커지면 성공 확률도 커집니다.  따라서 공격자가 반복적인 무차별 대입 공격, 적극적 추측 공격을 통해 사전 공유 키를 알아내는 것이 가능합니다.  이 인증 방법은 이에 대해 안전하다고 가정하지 않으며 구현에서는 d 값이 이 공격을 방지할 만큼 충분히 큰지 확인해야 합니다.  또한 구현에서는 실패한 인증 시도 횟수가 특정 임계값에 도달한 후 일정 시간 동안 인증 시도를 거부하는 등의 대응 조치를 취해야 합니다.  이 메모에서는 그러한 임계값이나 시간을 권장하지 않습니다.
