     One mechanism is to do aggregation solely based on dynamically
     learned routing information. This has the danger of not specifying a
     precise enough range since when a route is not present, it is not
     always possible to distinguish whether it is temporarily unreachable
     or that it does not belong in the aggregate. Purely dynamic routing
     also does not allow the flexibility of defining what to aggregate
     within a range. The other mechanism is to do all aggregation based on
     ranges of blocks of IP addresses preconfigured in the router.  It is
     recommended that preconfiguration be used, since it more flexible and
     allows precise specification of the range of destinations to
     aggregate.
