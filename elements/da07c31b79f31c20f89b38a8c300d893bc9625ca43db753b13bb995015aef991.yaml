     [3] Lower layer security.  EAP does not require lower layers to
         provide security services such as per-packet confidentiality,
         authentication, integrity, and replay protection.  However, where
         these security services are available, EAP methods supporting Key
         Derivation (see Section 7.2.1) can be used to provide dynamic
         keying material.  This makes it possible to bind the EAP
         authentication to subsequent data and protect against data
         modification, spoofing, or replay.  See Section 7.1 for details.
