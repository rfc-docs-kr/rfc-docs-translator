     Diffserv uses the Differentiated Services field in the IP header (the
     DS field) consisting of six bits in what was formerly known as the
     Type of Service (TOS) octet.  The DS field is used to indicate the
     forwarding treatment that a packet should receive at a transit node
     [RFC2474].  Diffserv includes the concept of Per-Hop Behavior (PHB)
     groups.  Using the PHBs, several classes of services can be defined
     using different classification, policing, shaping, and scheduling
     rules.

  Diffserv는 이전에 TOS(Type of Service) 옥텟으로 알려진 6비트로 구성된 IP 헤더(DS 필드)의 차별화된 서비스 필드를 사용합니다. DS 필드는 패킷이 전송 노드[RFC2474]에서 수신해야 하는 전달 처리를 나타내는 데 사용됩니다. Diffserv에는 PHB(Per-Hop Behavior) 그룹 개념이 포함되어 있습니다. PHB를 사용하면 다양한 분류, 정책, 형성 및 예약 규칙을 사용하여 여러 서비스 클래스를 정의할 수 있습니다.
