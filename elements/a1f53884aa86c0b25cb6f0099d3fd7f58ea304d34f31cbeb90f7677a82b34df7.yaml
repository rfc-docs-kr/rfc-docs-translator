     Warning: Because the SessionID is transmitted without encryption or
              immediate MAC protection, servers MUST not place
              confidential information in session identifiers or let the
              contents of fake session identifiers cause any breach of
              security.  (Note that the content of the handshake as a
              whole, including the SessionID, is protected by the Finished
              messages exchanged at the end of the handshake.)
