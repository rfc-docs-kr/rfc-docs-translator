        The AVP Flags field informs the receiver how each attribute must
        be handled.  New Diameter applications SHOULD NOT define
        additional AVP Flag bits.  However, note that new Diameter
        applications MAY define additional bits within the AVP header, and
        an unrecognized bit SHOULD be considered an error.  The sender of
        the AVP MUST set 'R' (reserved) bits to 0 and the receiver SHOULD
        ignore all 'R' (reserved) bits.  The 'P' bit has been reserved for
        future usage of end-to-end security.  At the time of writing,
        there are no end-to-end security mechanisms specified; therefore,
        the 'P' bit SHOULD be set to 0.
