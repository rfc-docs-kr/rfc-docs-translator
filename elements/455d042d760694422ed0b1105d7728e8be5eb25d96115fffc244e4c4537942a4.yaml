     When both UDP and TCP candidates are offered for the same media
     stream, and one transport protocol should be preferred over the
     other, the type preferences for the preferred transport protocol
     candidates SHOULD be increased and/or the type preferences for the
     other transport protocol candidates SHOULD be decreased.  How much
     the values should be increased or decreased depends on whether it is
     more important to choose a certain transport protocol or a certain
     candidate type.  If the candidate type is more important (e.g., even
     if UDP is preferred, TCP host candidates are preferred over UDP
     server reflexive candidates) changing type preference values by one
     for the other transport protocol candidates is enough.  On the other
     hand, if the transport protocol is more important (e.g., any UDP
     candidate is preferred over any TCP candidate), all the preferred
     transport protocol candidates SHOULD have type preference higher than
     the other transport protocol candidates.  However, it is RECOMMENDED
     that the relayed candidates are still preferred lower than the other
     candidate types.  For RTP-based media streams, it is RECOMMENDED that
     UDP candidates are preferred over TCP candidates.
