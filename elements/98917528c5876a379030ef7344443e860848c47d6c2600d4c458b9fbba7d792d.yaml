     In should also be noted that the present method of flat address
     allocations imposes a large bureaucratic cost on the central address
     allocation authority. For scaling reasons unrelated to address space
     exhaustion or routing table overflow, this should be changed. Using
     the mechanism proposed in this paper will have the fortunate side
     effect of distributing the address allocation procedure, greatly
     reducing the load on the central authority.
