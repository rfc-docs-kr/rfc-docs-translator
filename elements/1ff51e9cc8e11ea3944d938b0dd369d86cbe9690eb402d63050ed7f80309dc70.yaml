        o  As a performance optimization, where DNAv4 fails to provide a
           benefit, it should add little or no delay compared to today's
           DHCP processing.  In practice, this implies that DHCP
           processing needs to proceed in parallel.  Waiting for DNAv4 to
           fail before beginning DHCP processing can greatly increase
           total processing time, the opposite of the desired effect.
