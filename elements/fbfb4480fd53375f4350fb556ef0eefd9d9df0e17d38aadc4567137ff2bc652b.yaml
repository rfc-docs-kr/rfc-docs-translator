     Some field bodies in this standard have specific syntactical
     structure more restrictive than the unstructured field bodies
     described above. These are referred to as "structured" field bodies.
     Structured field bodies are sequences of specific lexical tokens as
     described in sections 3 and 4 of this standard.  Many of these tokens
     are allowed (according to their syntax) to be introduced or end with
     comments (as described in section 3.2.3) as well as the space (SP,
     ASCII value 32) and horizontal tab (HTAB, ASCII value 9) characters
     (together known as the white space characters, WSP), and those WSP
     characters are subject to header "folding" and "unfolding" as
     described in section 2.2.3.  Semantic analysis of structured field
     bodies is given along with their syntax.

  이 표준의 일부 필드 본문은 위에 설명된 구조화되지 않은 필드 본문보다 더 제한적인 특정 구문 구조를 가지고 있습니다. 이를 "구조화된" 필드 본문이라고 합니다. 구조화된 필드 본문은 이 표준의 섹션 3과 4에 설명된 특정 어휘 토큰의 시퀀스입니다.  이러한 토큰 중 다수는 구문에 따라 공백(SP, ASCII 값 32) 및 가로 탭(HTAB, ASCII 값 9)뿐만 아니라 주석(섹션 3.2.3에 설명됨)으로 시작하거나 끝날 수 있습니다. 문자(공백 문자, WSP라고도 함)와 해당 WSP 문자에는 섹션 2.2.3에 설명된 대로 헤더 "접기" 및 "펼치기"가 적용됩니다.  구조화된 필드 본문의 의미 분석이 해당 구문과 함께 제공됩니다.
