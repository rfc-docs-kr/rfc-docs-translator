        In order to avoid confusion between new Requests and
        retransmissions, the Identifier value chosen for each new Request
        need only be different from the previous Request, but need not be
        unique within the conversation.  One way to achieve this is to
        start the Identifier at an initial value and increment it for each
        new Request.  Initializing the first Identifier with a random
        number rather than starting from zero is recommended, since it
        makes sequence attacks somewhat more difficult.
