                 The values for the index objects inetCidrRouteDest and
                 inetCidrRoutePfxLen must be consistent.  When the value
                 of inetCidrRouteDest (excluding the zone index, if one
                 is present) is x, then the bitwise logical-AND
                 of x with the value of the mask formed from the
                 corresponding index object inetCidrRoutePfxLen MUST be
                 equal to x.  If not, then the index pair is not
                 consistent and an inconsistentName error must be
                 returned on SET or CREATE requests."
