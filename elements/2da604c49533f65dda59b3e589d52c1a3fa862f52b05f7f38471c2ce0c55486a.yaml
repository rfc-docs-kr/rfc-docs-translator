          However, it might still be useful to distinguish at higher
          levels between broadcasts and non-broadcasts, especially in
          gateways. This is the most useful case of broadcast; it allows a
          host to discover gateways without wired-in tables, it is the
          basis for address resolution protocols, and it is also useful
          for accessing such utilities as name servers, time servers,
          etc., without requiring wired-in addresses.
