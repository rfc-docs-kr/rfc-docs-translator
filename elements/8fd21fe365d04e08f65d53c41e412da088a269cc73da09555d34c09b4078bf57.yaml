              When the LSA is describing a network (LS type = 2, 3 or 5),
              the network's IP address is easily derived by masking the
              Link State ID with the network/subnet mask contained in the
              body of the LSA.  When the LSA is describing a router (LS
              type = 1 or 4), the Link State ID is always the described
              router's OSPF Router ID.
