     A Diameter client or proxy MUST match the Hop-by-Hop Identifier in an
     answer received against the list of pending requests.  The
     corresponding message should be removed from the list of pending
     requests.  It SHOULD ignore answers received that do not match a
     known Hop-by-Hop Identifier.
