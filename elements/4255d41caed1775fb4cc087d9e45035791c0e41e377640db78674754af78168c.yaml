        The Identity Type is used to query the identity of the peer.
        Generally, the authenticator will issue this as the initial
        Request.  An optional displayable message MAY be included to
        prompt the peer in the case where there is an expectation of
        interaction with a user.  A Response of Type 1 (Identity) SHOULD
        be sent in Response to a Request with a Type of 1 (Identity).
