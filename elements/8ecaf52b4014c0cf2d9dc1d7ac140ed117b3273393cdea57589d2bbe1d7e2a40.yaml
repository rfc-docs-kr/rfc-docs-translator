        o  ICNs makes it difficult to identify the origin of a request (as
           mentioned in Section 3.3), slowing down the process of blocking
           requests and requiring alternative mechanisms to differentiate
           legitimate requests from inappropriate ones as access control
           lists (ACLs) will probably be of little value for ICN requests.
