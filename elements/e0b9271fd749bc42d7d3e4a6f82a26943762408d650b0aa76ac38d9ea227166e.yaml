        The accounting message will carry the Application Id of the
        application that is using it.  The application itself will process
        the received accounting records or forward them to an accounting
        server.  There is no accounting application advertisement required
        during capabilities exchange, and the accounting messages will be
        routed the same way as any of the other application messages.
