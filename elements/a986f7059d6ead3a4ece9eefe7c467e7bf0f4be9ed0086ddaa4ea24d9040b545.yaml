     Maintenance of DNS with a subnetted class A is somewhat painful.  As
     part of the mechanism for providing reverse address lookups, DNS
     maintains a "IN-ADDR.ARPA" reverse domain.  This is configured by
     reversing the dotted decimal network number, appending "IN-ADDR.ARPA"
     and using this as a type of pseudo-domain.  Individual hosts then end
     up pointing back to a host name.  Thus, for example, 131.108.1.111
     has a DNS record "111.1.108.131.IN-ADDR.ARPA."  Since the pseudo-
     domains can only be delegated on a byte boundary, this becomes
     painful if a stub domain receives a block of address space that does
     not fall on a byte boundary.  The solution in this case is to
     enumerate all of the possible byte combinations involved.  This is
     painful, but workable.  This is discussed further below.
