     If the M3UA layer subsequently receives an SCTP-COMMUNICATION_DOWN or
     SCTP-RESTART indication primitive from the underlying SCTP layer, it
     will inform the Layer Management by invoking the M-SCTP_STATUS
     indication primitive.  The state of the ASP will be moved to ASP-
     DOWN.  At an ASP, the MTP3-User will be informed of the
     unavailability of any affected SS7 destinations through the use of
     MTP-PAUSE indication primitives.
