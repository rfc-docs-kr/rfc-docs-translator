     This document describes a means of negotiating the use of the
     encrypt-then-MAC security mechanism in place of the existing MAC-
     then-encrypt mechanism in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
     Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  The MAC-then-encrypt mechanism has
     been the subject of a number of security vulnerabilities over a
     period of many years.

  이 문서에서는 TLS(Transport Layer Security) 및 DTLS(Datagram Transport Layer Security)에서 기존 MAC-then-encrypt 메커니즘 대신 암호화-then-MAC 보안 메커니즘을 사용하도록 협상하는 방법을 설명합니다. MAC-then-encrypt 메커니즘은 수년에 걸쳐 여러 보안 취약점의 대상이 되었습니다.
