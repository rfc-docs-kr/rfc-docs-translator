              When a TCP connection is OPENed passively and a packet
              arrives with a completed IP Source Route option (containing
              a return route), TCP MUST save the return route and use it
              for all segments sent on this connection.  If a different
              source route arrives in a later segment, the later
              definition SHOULD override the earlier one.
