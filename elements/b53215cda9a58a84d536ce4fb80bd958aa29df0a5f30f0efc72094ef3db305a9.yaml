     6.  If for any reason an IPv6 prefix has to be reassigned, it is
         RECOMMENDED to reassign an IPv6 prefix (that was previously
         assigned to a given CPE) to another CPE only when all the
         resources in use associated with that prefix are cleared from the
         AFTR.  Doing so avoids redirecting traffic, destined to the
         previous prefix owner, to the new one.

  1. 어떤 이유로든 IPv6 접두사를 재할당해야 하는 경우 해당 접두사와 관련하여 사용 중인 모든 리소스가 AFTR.  이렇게 하면 이전 접두사 소유자로 향하는 트래픽이 새 소유자로 리디렉션되는 것을 방지할 수 있습니다.
