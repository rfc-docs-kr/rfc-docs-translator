     Terminations have properties.  The properties have unique
     PropertyIDs.  Most properties have default values, which are
     explicitly defined in this standard or in a package (see Section 12)
     or set by provisioning.  If not provisioned otherwise, all
     descriptors except TerminationState and LocalControl default to
     empty/"no value" when a Termination is first created or returned to
     the null Context.  The default contents of the two exceptions are
     described in sections 7.1.5 and 7.1.7.
