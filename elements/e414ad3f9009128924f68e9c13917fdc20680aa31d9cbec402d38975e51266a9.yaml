     A Diameter node MAY initiate connections from a source port other
     than the one that it declares it accepts incoming connections on, and
     it MUST always be prepared to receive connections on port 3868 for
     TCP or SCTP and port 5658 for TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP connections.
     When DNS-based peer discovery (Section 5.2) is used, the port numbers
     received from SRV records take precedence over the default ports
     (3868 and 5658).
