           DISCUSSION:
                The trailer protocol is a link-layer encapsulation
                technique that rearranges the data contents of packets
                sent on the physical network.  In some cases, trailers
                improve the throughput of higher layer protocols by
                reducing the amount of data copying within the operating
                system.  Higher layer protocols are unaware of trailer
                use, but both the sending and receiving host MUST
                understand the protocol if it is used.
