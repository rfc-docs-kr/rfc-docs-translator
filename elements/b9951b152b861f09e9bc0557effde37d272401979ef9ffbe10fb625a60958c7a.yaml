     *  The average deviation, ADEV, estimated through an exponentially
        smoothed average of the absolute value of the difference between
        the observed delay and the current average.  The retransmission
        timer, in TCP, is set to the sum of the average delay plus N times
        the average deviation. The maximum value of the timer should
        however be bounded for the protocol defined in this document, in
        order to guarantee that no repeated packet would be received by
        the gateways after LONG-TIMER seconds.  A suggested maximum value
        is 4 seconds.
