     One aspect of Internet services which will be notably affected by a
     move to either "supernetted" class-C network numbers or subdivided
     class-A's will be the mechanism used for address-to-name translation:
     the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone of the domain system. Because this zone is
     delegated on octet boundaries only, any address allocation plan which
     uses bitmask-oriented addressing will cause some degree of difficulty
     for those which maintain parts of the IN-ADDR.ARPA zone.
