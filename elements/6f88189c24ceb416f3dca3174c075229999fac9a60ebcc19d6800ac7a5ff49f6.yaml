                   In addition, on some large multi-user hosts, a delayed
                   ACK can substantially reduce protocol processing
                   overhead by reducing the total number of packets to be
                   processed [TCP:5].  However, excessive delays on ACK's
                   can disturb the round-trip timing and packet "clocking"
                   algorithms [TCP:7].
