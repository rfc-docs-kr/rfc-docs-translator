     Constraint-based routing:  A class of routing protocols that takes
        specified traffic attributes, network constraints, and policy
        constraints into account when making routing decisions.
        Constraint-based routing is applicable to traffic aggregates as
        well as flows.  It is a generalization of QoS-based routing.

  제약 기반 라우팅: 라우팅 결정을 내릴 때 지정된 트래픽 속성, 네트워크 제약 및 정책 제약을 고려하는 라우팅 프로토콜 클래스입니다. 제약 기반 라우팅은 트래픽 집계와 흐름에 적용 가능합니다. 이는 QoS 기반 라우팅을 일반화한 것입니다.
