     Since the CER/CEA messages cannot be proxied, it is still possible
     that an upstream agent will receive a message for which it has no
     available peers to handle the application that corresponds to the
     Command Code.  In such instances, the 'E' bit is set in the answer
     message (Section 7) with the Result-Code AVP set to
     DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER to inform the downstream agent to take
     action (e.g., re-routing request to an alternate peer).
