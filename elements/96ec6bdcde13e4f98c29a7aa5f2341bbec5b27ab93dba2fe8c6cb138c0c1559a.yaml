        One possible solution is for each multi-homed organization to
        obtain its IP address space independently from the providers to
        which it is attached.  This allows each multi-homed organization
        to base its IP assignments on a single prefix, and to thereby
        summarize the set of all IP addresses reachable within that
        organization via a single prefix.  The disadvantage of this
        approach is that since the IP address for that organization has no
        relationship to the addresses of any particular TRD, the TRDs to
        which this organization is attached will need to advertise the
        prefix for this organization to other providers.  Other providers
        (potentially worldwide) will need to maintain an explicit entry
        for that organization in their routing tables.
