              DISCUSSION:
                   Including the Type-of-Service field in the route cache
                   and considering it in the host route algorithm will
                   provide the necessary mechanism for the future when
                   Type-of-Service routing is commonly used in the
                   Internet.  See Section 3.2.1.6.
