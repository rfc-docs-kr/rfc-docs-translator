     This RFC describes methods to preserve IP address space by not
     allocating globally unique IP addresses to hosts private to an
     enterprise while still permitting full network layer connectivity
     between all hosts inside an enterprise as well as between all public
     hosts of different enterprises. The authors hope, that using these
     methods, significant savings can be made on allocating IP address
     space.
