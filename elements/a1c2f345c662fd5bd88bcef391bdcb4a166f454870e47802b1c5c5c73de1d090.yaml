     The data for the optional AVPs is represented in hexadecimal form
     since the format of these AVPs is not known at the time of definition
     of the Example-AVP group nor (likely) at the time when the example
     instance of this AVP is interpreted -- except by Diameter
     implementations that support the same set of AVPs.  The encoding
     example illustrates how padding is used and how length fields are
     calculated.  Also, note that AVPs may be present in the Grouped AVP
     value that the receiver cannot interpret (here, the Recover-Policy
     and Futuristic-Acct-Record AVPs).  The length of the Example-AVP is
     the sum of all the length of the member AVPs, including their
     padding, plus the Example-AVP header size.
