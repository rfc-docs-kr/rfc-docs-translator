          There may be several instances of an LSA present in the
          Autonomous System, all at the same time.  It must then be
          determined which instance is more recent.  This determination is
          made by examining the LS sequence, LS checksum and LS age
          fields.  These fields are also contained in the 20-byte LSA
          header.
