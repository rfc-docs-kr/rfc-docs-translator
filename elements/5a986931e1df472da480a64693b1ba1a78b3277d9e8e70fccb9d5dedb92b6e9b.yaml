     Implementation Note: Public-key-encrypted data is represented as an
                          opaque vector <0..2^16-1> (see Section 4.7).
                          Thus, the RSA-encrypted PreMasterSecret in a
                          ClientKeyExchange is preceded by two length
                          bytes.  These bytes are redundant in the case of
                          RSA because the EncryptedPreMasterSecret is the
                          only data in the ClientKeyExchange and its
                          length can therefore be unambiguously
                          determined.  The SSLv3 specification was not
                          clear about the encoding of public-key-encrypted
                          data, and therefore many SSLv3 implementations
                          do not include the length bytes, encoding the
                          RSA encrypted data directly in the
                          ClientKeyExchange message.
