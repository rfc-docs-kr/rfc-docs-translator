     For example, within EAP-TLS [RFC2716], in the client authentication
     handshake, the server authenticates the peer, but does not receive a
     protected indication of whether the peer has authenticated it.  In
     contrast, the peer authenticates the server and is aware of whether
     the server has authenticated it.  In the session resumption
     handshake, the peer authenticates the server, but does not receive a
     protected indication of whether the server has authenticated it.  In
     this mode, the server authenticates the peer and is aware of whether
     the peer has authenticated it.
