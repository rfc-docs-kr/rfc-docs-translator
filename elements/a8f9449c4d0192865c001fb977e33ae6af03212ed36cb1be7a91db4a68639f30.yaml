     The failover model supports an "n+k" redundancy model, where "n" ASPs
     is the minimum number of redundant ASPs required to handle traffic
     and "k" ASPs are available to take over for a failed or unavailable
     ASP.  Traffic SHOULD be sent after "n" ASPs are active.  "k" ASPs MAY
     be either active at the same time as "n" or kept inactive until
     needed due to a failed or unavailable ASP.
