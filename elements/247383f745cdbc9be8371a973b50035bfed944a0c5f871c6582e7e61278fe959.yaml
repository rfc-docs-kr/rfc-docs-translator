     There are many read-write and read-create management objects defined
     in this MIB.  Such objects are often sensitive or vulnerable in some
     network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
     environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
     network operations.  The use of SNMP Version 3 is recommended over
     prior versions for configuration control as its security model is
     improved.
