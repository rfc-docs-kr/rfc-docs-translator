              The interface state must be at least Waiting for any Hello
              Packets to be sent out the NBMA interface.  Hello Packets
              are then sent directly (as unicasts) to some subset of a
              router's neighbors.  Sometimes an Hello Packet is sent
              periodically on a timer; at other times it is sent as a
              response to a received Hello Packet.  A router's hello-
              sending behavior varies depending on whether the router
              itself is eligible to become Designated Router.
