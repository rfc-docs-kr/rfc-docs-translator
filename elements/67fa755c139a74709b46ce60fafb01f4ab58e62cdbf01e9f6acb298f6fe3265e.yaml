              A Destination Unreachable message that is received with code
              0 (Net), 1 (Host), or 5 (Bad Source Route) may result from a
              routing transient and MUST therefore be interpreted as only
              a hint, not proof, that the specified destination is
              unreachable [IP:11].  For example, it MUST NOT be used as
              proof of a dead gateway (see Section 3.3.1).
