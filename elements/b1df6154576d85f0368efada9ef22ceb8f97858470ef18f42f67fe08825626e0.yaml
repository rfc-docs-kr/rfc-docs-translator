     This testbed also implements an "on-filesystem cache" to allocate
     caching data on a UNIX filesystem.  The on-filesystem cache system
     accommodates two kinds of caches: "individual cache" and "shared
     cache."  Individual cache is accessible for one dedicated router for
     the individual user, while shared cache is accessible for a set of
     routers in the same group to avoid duplicated caching in the
     neighborhood for cooperative caching.
