     Handling an ICE offer with TCP candidates works in a similar way as
     with UDP candidates.  First, ICE support is verified (including the
     check for ice-mismatch described in Section 5.1 of [RFC5245]) and
     agent roles are determined.  Candidates are gathered using the
     techniques described in Section 5 and prioritized as described in
     Section 4.2.  Default candidates are selected taking into account the
     considerations in Section 4.3.  The SDP answer is encoded as in
     Section 4.3 of [RFC5245], with the exception of TCP candidates whose
     encoding is described in Section 4.5.
