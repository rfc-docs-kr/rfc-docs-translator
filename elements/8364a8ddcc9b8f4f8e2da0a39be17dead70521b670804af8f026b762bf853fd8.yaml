     dc_cert_verify_algorithm:  The signature algorithm of the Credential
        key pair, where the type SignatureScheme is as defined in
        [RFC8446].  This is expected to be the same as the sender's
        CertificateVerify.algorithm (as described in Section 4.1.3).
        When using RSA, the public key MUST NOT use the rsaEncryption OID.
        As a result, the following algorithms are not allowed for use with
        delegated credentials: rsa_pss_rsae_sha256, rsa_pss_rsae_sha384,
        and rsa_pss_rsae_sha512.
