     During account setup, the MUA will identify servers that provide
     account services such as mail access and mail submission (Section 5.1
     describes one way to do this).  The certificates for these servers
     are verified using the rules described in [RFC7817] and PKIX
     [RFC5280].  In the event that the certificate does not validate due
     to an expired certificate, a lack of an appropriate chain of trust,
     or a lack of an identifier match, the MUA MAY offer to create a
     persistent binding between that certificate and the saved hostname
     for the server, for use when accessing that account's servers.  This
     is called "certificate pinning".
