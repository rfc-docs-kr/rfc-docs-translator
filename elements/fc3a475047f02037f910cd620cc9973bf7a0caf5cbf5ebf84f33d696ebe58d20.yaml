      This appendix gives one possible algorithm for setting the host bits
      in Link State IDs.  The choice of such an algorithm is a local
      decision. Separate routers are free to use different algorithms,
      since the only LSAs affected are the ones that the router itself
      originates. The only requirement on the algorithms used is that the
      network's IP address should be used as the Link State ID whenever
      possible; this maximizes interoperability with OSPF implementations
      predating RFC 1583.
