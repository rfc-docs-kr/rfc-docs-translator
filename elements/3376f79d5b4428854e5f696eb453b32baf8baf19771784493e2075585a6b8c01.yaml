     At the ASP, the ASP Active Ack message received is not acknowledged.
     Layer Management is informed with an M-ASP_ACTIVE confirm primitive.
     It is possible for the ASP to receive Data messages before the ASP
     Active Ack message as the ASP Active Ack and Data messages from an SG
     or IPSP may be sent on different SCTP streams.  Message loss is
     possible, as the ASP does not consider itself in the ASP-ACTIVE state
     until receipt of the ASP Active Ack message.
