     The first packet of every TCP session tries to establish a session
     and contains connection startup information. The first packet of a
     TCP session may be recognized by the presence of SYN bit and absence
     of ACK bit in the TCP flags. All TCP packets, with the exception of
     the first packet, must have the ACK bit set.
