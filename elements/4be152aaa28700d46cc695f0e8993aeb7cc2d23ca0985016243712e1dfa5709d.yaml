                   Some systems have not implemented half-closed
                   connections, presumably because they do not fit into
                   the I/O model of their particular operating system.  On
                   these systems, once an application has called CLOSE, it
                   can no longer read input data from the connection; this
                   is referred to as a "half-duplex" TCP close sequence.
