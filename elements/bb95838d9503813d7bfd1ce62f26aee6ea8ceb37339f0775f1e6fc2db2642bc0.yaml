     Horster, Michels, and Petersen categorized many different ElGamal
     signature methods, demonstrated their equivalence, and showed how to
     convert signatures of one type to another type [HMP1994].  In their
     terminology, the signature method of Section 5.3 and [KT1994] is a
     Type IV method, which is why it is denoted as KT-IV.
