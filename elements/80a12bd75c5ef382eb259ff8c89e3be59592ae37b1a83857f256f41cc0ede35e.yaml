        When a DiameterIdentity value is used to identify a Diameter node,
        the contents of the string MUST be the Fully Qualified Domain Name
        (FQDN) of the Diameter node.  If multiple Diameter nodes run on
        the same host, each Diameter node MUST be assigned a unique
        DiameterIdentity.  If a Diameter node can be identified by several
        FQDNs, a single FQDN should be picked at startup and used as the
        only DiameterIdentity for that node, whatever the connection on
        which it is sent.  In this document, note that DiameterIdentity is
        in ASCII form in order to be compatible with existing DNS
        infrastructure.  See Appendix D for interactions between the
        Diameter protocol and Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs).
