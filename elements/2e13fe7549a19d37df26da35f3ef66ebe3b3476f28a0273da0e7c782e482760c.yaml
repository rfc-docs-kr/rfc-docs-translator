   Warning: Completely anonymous connections only provide protection
            against passive eavesdropping. Unless an independent tamper-
            proof channel is used to verify that the finished messages
            were not replaced by an attacker, server authentication is
            required in environments where active man-in-the-middle
            attacks are a concern.
