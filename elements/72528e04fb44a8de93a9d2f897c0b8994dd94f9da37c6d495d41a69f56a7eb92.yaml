     When a TCP connection is established for the "submissions" service
     (default port 465), a TLS handshake begins immediately.  Clients MUST
     implement the certificate validation mechanism described in
     [RFC7817].  Once the TLS session is established, Message Submission
     protocol data [RFC6409] is exchanged as TLS application data for the
     remainder of the TCP connection.  (Note: The "submissions" service
     name is defined in Section 7.3 of this document and follows the usual
     convention that the name of a service layered on top of Implicit TLS
     consists of the name of the service as used without TLS, with an "s"
     appended.)
