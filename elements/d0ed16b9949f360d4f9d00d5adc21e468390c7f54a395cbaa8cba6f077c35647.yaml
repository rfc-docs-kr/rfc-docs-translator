     Relaying packets through a relay server is often the NAT traversal
     technique that has the highest success probability: communicating via
     a relay that is in the public Internet looks like normal client-
     server communication for the NATs and is supported in practice by all
     existing NATs, regardless of their filtering and mapping behavior.
     However, using a relay has several drawbacks, e.g., it usually
     results in a sub-optimal path for the packets, the relay needs to
     exist and it needs to be discovered, the relay is a possible single
     point of failure, relaying consumes potentially a lot of resources of
     the relay server, etc.  Therefore, relaying is often used as the last
     resort when no direct path can be created with other NAT traversal
     techniques.
