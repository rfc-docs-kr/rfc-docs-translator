     This is a one-time procedural exception to the rules in [RFC6335].
     This requires explicit IESG approval and does not set a precedent.
     Note: Since the purpose of this alternate usage assignment is to
     align with widespread existing practice and there is no known usage
     of UDP port 465 for Message Submission over TLS, IANA has not
     assigned an alternate usage of UDP port 465.
