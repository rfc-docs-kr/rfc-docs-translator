     TWAMP-Control is a derivative of the OWAMP-Control for two-way
     measurements.  All TWAMP-Control messages are similar in format and
     follow similar guidelines to those defined in Section 3 of OWAMP
     [RFC4656] with the exceptions outlined in the following sections.
     One such exception is the Fetch-Session command, which is not used in
     TWAMP.
