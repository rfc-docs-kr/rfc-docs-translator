  -- Data Path Table
  --
  -- The Data Path Table enumerates the Differentiated Services
  -- Functional Data Paths within this device.  Each entry in this table
  -- is indexed by ifIndex and ifDirection.  Each entry provides the
  -- first Differentiated Services Functional Data Path Element to
  -- process data flowing along specific data path.  This table should
  -- have at most two entries for each interface capable of
  -- Differentiated Services processing on this device: ingress and
  -- egress.
