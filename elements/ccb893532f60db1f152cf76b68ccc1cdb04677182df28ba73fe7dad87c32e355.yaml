        Tutorial: Administrators assign permissions to roles as needed to
        perform functions in the system. Administrators separately assign
        user identities to roles. When a user accesses the system in an
        identity (for which the user has been registered) and initiates a
        session using a role (to which the user has been assigned), then
        the permissions that have been assigned to the role are available
        to be exercised by the user.
