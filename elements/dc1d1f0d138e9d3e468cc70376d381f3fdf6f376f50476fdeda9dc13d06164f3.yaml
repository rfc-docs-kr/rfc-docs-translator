     After the TLS handshake has been completed, both parties MUST
     immediately decide whether or not to continue based on the
     authentication and privacy achieved.  The SMTP client and server may
     decide to move ahead even if the TLS negotiation ended with no
     authentication and/or no privacy because most SMTP services are
     performed with no authentication and no privacy, but some SMTP
     clients or servers may want to continue only if a particular level of
     authentication and/or privacy was achieved.
