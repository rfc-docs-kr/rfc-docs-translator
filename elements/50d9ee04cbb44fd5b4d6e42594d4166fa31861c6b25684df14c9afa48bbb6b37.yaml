        Note that an address change need not happen immediately.  A domain
        which has changed service providers may still advertise its prefix
        through its new service provider.  Since upper levels in the
        routing hierarchy will perform routing based on the longest
        prefix, reachability is preserved, although the aggregation and
        scalability of the routing information has greatly diminished.
        Thus, a domain which does change its topology should change
        addresses as soon as convenient.  The timing and mechanics of such
        changes must be the result of agreements between the old service
        provider, the new provider, and the domain.
