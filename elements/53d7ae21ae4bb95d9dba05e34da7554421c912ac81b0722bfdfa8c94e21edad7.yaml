     Existing EAP methods define message integrity checks (MICs) that
     cover more than one EAP packet.  For example, EAP-TLS [RFC2716]
     defines a MIC over a TLS record that could be split into multiple
     fragments; within the FINISHED message, the MIC is computed over
     previous messages.  Where the MIC covers more than one EAP packet, a
     MIC validation failure is typically considered a fatal error.
