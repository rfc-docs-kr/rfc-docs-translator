     A Realm Specific Address IP (RSA-IP) client adopts an IP address from
     the external address space when connecting to a host in external
     realm. Once an RSA-IP client assumes an external address, no other
     host in private or external domain can assume the same address, until
     that address is released by the RSA-IP client.
