              o   Else, if the destination of this route is an AS boundary
                  router, a summary-LSA should be originated if and only
                  if the routing table entry describes the preferred path
                  to the AS boundary router (see Step 3 of Section 16.4).
                  If so, a Type 4 summary-LSA is originated for the
                  destination, with Link State ID equal to the AS boundary
                  router's Router ID and metric equal to the routing table
                  entry's cost. Note: these LSAs should not be generated
                  if Area A has been configured as a stub area.
