     However, it is possible for an attacker to forge a Success packet
     after the server has authenticated to the peer, but before the peer
     has authenticated to the server.  If the peer were to accept the
     forged Success packet and attempt to access the network when it had
     not yet successfully authenticated to the server, a denial of service
     attack could be mounted against the peer.  After such an attack, if
     the lower layer supports failure indications, the authenticator can
     synchronize state with the peer by providing a lower layer failure
     indication.  See Section 7.12 for details.
