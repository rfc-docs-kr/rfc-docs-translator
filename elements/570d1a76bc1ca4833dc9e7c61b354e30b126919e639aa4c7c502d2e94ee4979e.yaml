     Note that during failures, partial routing of traffic to a site which
     takes its address space from one service provider but which is
     actually reachable only through another (i.e., the case of a site
     which has change service providers) may occur because such traffic
     will be routed along the path advertised by the aggregated route.
     Rule #2 will prevent any real problem from occurring by forcing such
     traffic to be discarded by the advertiser of the aggregated route,
     but the output of "traceroute" and other similar tools will suggest
     that a problem exists within the service provider advertising the
     aggregate, which may be confusing to network operators (see the
     example in section 5.2 for details). Solutions to this problem appear
     to be challenging and not likely to be implementable by current
     Inter-Domain protocols within the time-frame suggested by this
     document. This decision may need to be revisited as Inter-Domain
     protocols evolve.
