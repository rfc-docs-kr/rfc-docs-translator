     Although STARTTLS appears only slightly more complex than
     separate-port TLS, we again learned the lesson that complexity is the
     enemy of security in the form of the STARTTLS command injection
     vulnerability (Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) vulnerability
     ID #555316 [CERT-555316]).  Although there's nothing inherently wrong
     with STARTTLS, the fact that it resulted in a common implementation
     error (made independently by multiple implementers) suggests that it
     is a less secure architecture than Implicit TLS.
