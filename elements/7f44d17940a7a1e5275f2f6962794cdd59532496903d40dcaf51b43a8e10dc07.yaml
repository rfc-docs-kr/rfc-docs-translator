     For carrier grade networks, the failure or isolation of a particular
     signalling process should not cause stable calls or transactions to
     be lost.  This implies that signalling processes need, in some cases,
     to share the call/transaction state or be able to pass the call state
     information between each other.  In the case of ASPs performing call
     processing, coordination may also be required with the related Media
     Gateway to transfer the MGC control for a particular trunk
     termination.  However, this sharing or communication of
     call/transaction state information is outside the scope of this
     document.
