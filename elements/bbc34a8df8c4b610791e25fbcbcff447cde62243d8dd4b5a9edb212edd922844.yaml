      Neighbor IP address
          The IP address of the neighboring router's interface to the
          attached network.  Used as the Destination IP address when
          protocol packets are sent as unicasts along this adjacency.
          Also used in router-LSAs as the Link ID for the attached network
          if the neighboring router is selected to be Designated Router
          (see Section 12.4.1).  The Neighbor IP address is learned when
          Hello packets are received from the neighbor.  For virtual
          links, the Neighbor IP address is learned during the routing
          table build process (see Section 15).
