     A NAPT router enroute could serve as RSAP-IP-Server, when the outer
     encapsulation is TCP/UDP based and is addressed between the RSAP-IP-
     Client and external peer. This approach requires the external peer to
     be  the end-point of TCP/UDP based tunnel. Using this approach,
     RSAP-IP-Clients may pursue any of the IPsec techniques, namely
     transport or tunnel mode authentication and confidentiality using AH
     and ESP headers on the embedded packets.  Note however, IPsec tunnel
     mode is not a valid type of encapsulation, as a NAPT router cannot
     provide routing transparency to AH and ESP protocols.
