          In order to ensure two-way communication between adjacent
          routers, the Hello packet contains the list of all routers on
          the network from which Hello Packets have been seen recently.
          The Hello packet also contains the router's current choice for
          Designated Router and Backup Designated Router.  A value of
          0.0.0.0 in these fields means that one has not yet been
          selected.
