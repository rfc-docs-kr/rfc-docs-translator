     Another option for measuring transport performance would be to use
     QoS metrics, not at the output of the network like with IPPM, but at
     the input to the application.  For a live video-streaming application
     the relevant metrics would be startup latency, playout lag, and
     playout continuity.  The benefit of this approach is that it
     abstracts away all details of the underlying transport network, so it
     can be readily applied to compare between networks of different
     concepts (host-centric, information-centric, or other).  As implied
     earlier, the drawback of the approach is its dependence on the
     application, so it is likely that different types of applications
     will require different metrics.  It might be possible to identify
     standard metrics for each type of application, but the situation is
     not as clear as with IPPM metrics, and further investigation is
     necessary.
