              (1) Locate the receiving interface's configured key having
                  Key ID equal to that specified in the received OSPF
                  packet (see Figure 18). If the key is not found, or if
                  the key is not valid for reception (i.e., current time <
                  KeyStartAccept or current time >= KeyStopAccept), the
                  OSPF packet is discarded.
