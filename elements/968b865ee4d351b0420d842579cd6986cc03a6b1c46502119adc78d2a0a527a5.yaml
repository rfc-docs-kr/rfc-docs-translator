     If the TCP connection is established, the framing of RFC 4571 is
     utilized.  If the agent opened the connection and is a full agent, it
     MUST send a STUN connectivity check.  An agent MUST be prepared to
     receive a connectivity check over a connection it opened or accepted
     (note that this is true in general; ICE requires that an agent be
     prepared to receive a connectivity check at any time, even after ICE
     processing completes).  If a full agent receives a connectivity check
     after re-establishment of the connection, it MUST generate a
     triggered check over that connection in response if it has not
     already sent a check.  Once an agent has sent a check and received a
     successful response, the connection is considered Valid, and media
     can be sent (which includes a TLS or DTLS-SRTP session resumption or
     restart).
