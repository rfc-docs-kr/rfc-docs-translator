          However, in order to maintain full routing after the partition,
          an address range must not be split across multiple components of
          the area partition. Also, the backbone itself must not
          partition.  If it does, parts of the Autonomous System will
          become unreachable.  Backbone partitions can be repaired by
          configuring virtual links (see Section 15).
