        o  As a performance optimization, false negatives are acceptable.
           It is not an absolute requirement that this optimization
           correctly recognize a previously visited link in all possible
           cases.  For example, if a router ignores unicast ARP Requests,
           then DNAv4 will not be able to detect that it has returned to
           the same link in the future.  This is acceptable because the
           host still operates correctly as it did without DNAv4, just
           without the performance benefit.  Users and network operators
           who desire the performance improvement offered by DNAv4 can
           upgrade their routers to support DNAv4.
