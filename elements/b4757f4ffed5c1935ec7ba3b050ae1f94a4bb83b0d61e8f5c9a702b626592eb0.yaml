              DISCUSSION:
                   The ARP specification [LINK:2] suggests but does not
                   require a timeout mechanism to invalidate cache entries
                   when hosts change their Ethernet addresses.  The
                   prevalence of proxy ARP (see Section 2.4 of [INTRO:2])
                   has significantly increased the likelihood that cache
                   entries in hosts will become invalid, and therefore
                   some ARP-cache invalidation mechanism is now required
                   for hosts.  Even in the absence of proxy ARP, a long-
                   period cache timeout is useful in order to
                   automatically correct any bad ARP data that might have
                   been cached.
