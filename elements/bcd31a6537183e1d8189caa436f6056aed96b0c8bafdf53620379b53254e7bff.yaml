     In a REPLAY ATTACK, the attacker records a sequence of messages off
     of the wire and plays them back to the party which originally
     received them.  Note that the attacker does not need to be able to
     understand the messages.  He merely needs to capture and retransmit
     them.

  REPLAY 공격에서 공격자는 유선에서 일련의 메시지를 녹음하고 원래 수신한 당사자에게 이를 재생합니다. 공격자는 메시지를 이해할 필요가 없습니다. 그는 단지 그것들을 포착해서 재전송하기만 하면 됩니다.
