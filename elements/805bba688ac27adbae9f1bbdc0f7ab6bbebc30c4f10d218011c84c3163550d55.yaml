     o  In Section 7.5, text has been added on method-specific behavior,
        providing guidance on how EAP method-specific integrity checks
        should be processed.  Where possible, it is desirable for a
        method-specific MIC to be computed over the entire EAP packet,
        including the EAP layer header (Code, Identifier, Length) and EAP
        method layer header (Type, Type-Data).
