     NETCONF connections MUST be authenticated.  The transport protocol is
     responsible for authentication of the server to the client and
     authentication of the client to the server.  A NETCONF peer assumes
     that the connection's authentication information has been validated
     by the underlying transport protocol using sufficiently trustworthy
     mechanisms and that the peer's identity has been sufficiently proven.
