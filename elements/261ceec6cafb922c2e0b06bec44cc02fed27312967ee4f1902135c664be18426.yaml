     When using configuration information per [RFC6186], MUAs SHOULD NOT
     automatically establish new configurations that do not require TLS
     for all servers, unless there are no advertised configurations using
     TLS.  If such a configuration is chosen, prior to attempting to
     authenticate to the server or use the server for Message Submission,
     the MUA SHOULD warn the user that traffic to that server will not be
     encrypted and that it will therefore likely be intercepted by
     unauthorized parties.  The specific wording is to be determined by
     the implementation, but it should adequately capture the sense of
     risk, given the widespread incidence of mass surveillance of email
     traffic.
