          An implementation of OSPF must be able to access individual
          pieces of an area database.  This lookup function is based on an
          LSA's LS type, Link State ID and Advertising Router.[14] There
          will be a single instance (the most up-to-date) of each LSA in
          the database.  The database lookup function is invoked during
          the LSA flooding procedure (Section 13) and the routing table
          calculation (Section 16).  In addition, using this lookup
          function the router can determine whether it has itself ever
          originated a particular LSA, and if so, with what LS sequence
          number.
