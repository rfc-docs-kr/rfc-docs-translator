        2. (I) /COMSEC/ The initial part, i.e., the first communication
        step, or steps, of a protocol that is vulnerable to attack
        (especially a man-in-the-middle attack) during that part but, if
        that part is completed without being attacked, is subsequently not
        vulnerable in later steps (i.e., results in a secure communication
        association for which no man-in-the-middle attack is possible).
