     (Note 3) When included within a CoA-Request, these attributes
     represent an authorization change request.  When one of these
     attributes is omitted from a CoA-Request, the NAS assumes that the
     attribute value is to remain unchanged.  Attributes included in a
     CoA-Request replace all existing values of the same attribute(s).
