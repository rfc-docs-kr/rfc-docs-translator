              (6) The message digest is then calculated and appended to
                  the OSPF packet.  The authentication algorithm to be
                  used in calculating the digest is indicated by the key
                  itself.  Input to the authentication algorithm consists
                  of the OSPF packet and the secret key. When using MD5 as
                  the authentication algorithm, the message digest
                  calculation proceeds as follows:
