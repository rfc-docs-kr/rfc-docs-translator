     The usage of RTP over TCP is particularly useful when combined with
     Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) [RFC5766].  In this case,
     one of the agents would connect to its TURN server using TCP and
     obtain a TCP-based relayed candidate.  It would offer this to its
     peer agent as a candidate.  The other agent would initiate a TCP
     connection towards the TURN server.  When that connection is
     established, media can flow over the connections, through the TURN
     server.  The benefit of this usage is that it only requires the
     agents to make outbound TCP connections to a server on the public
     network.  This kind of operation is broadly interoperable through NAT
     and firewall devices.  Since it is a goal of ICE and this extension
     to provide highly reliable communications that "just work" in as
     broad a set of network deployments as possible, this use case is
     particularly important.
