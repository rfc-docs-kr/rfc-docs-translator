     The "barney" subtree filter contains three containment nodes
     (<users>, <user>, <company-info>), two content match nodes (<name>,
     <type>), and one selection node (<dept>).  The subtree selection
     criteria are not met because user "barney" is not a "superuser", and
     the entire subtree for "barney" (including its parent <user> entry)
     is excluded from the filter output.
