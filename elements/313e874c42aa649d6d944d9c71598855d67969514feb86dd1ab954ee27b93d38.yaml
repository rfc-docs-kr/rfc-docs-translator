              This field is the age of the LSA in seconds.  It should be
              processed as an unsigned 16-bit integer.  It is set to 0
              when the LSA is originated.  It must be incremented by
              InfTransDelay on every hop of the flooding procedure.  LSAs
              are also aged as they are held in each router's database.
