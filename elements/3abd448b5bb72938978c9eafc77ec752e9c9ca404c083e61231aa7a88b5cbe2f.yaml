     Success and Failure packets MUST NOT be sent by an EAP authenticator
     if the specification of the given method does not explicitly permit
     the method to finish at that point.  A peer EAP implementation
     receiving a Success or Failure packet where sending one is not
     explicitly permitted MUST silently discard it.  By default, an EAP
     peer MUST silently discard a "canned" Success packet (a Success
     packet sent immediately upon connection).  This ensures that a rogue
     authenticator will not be able to bypass mutual authentication by
     sending a Success packet prior to conclusion of the EAP method
     conversation.
