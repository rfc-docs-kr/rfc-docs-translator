          The first link-state routing protocol was developed for use in
          the ARPANET packet switching network.  This protocol is
          described in [Ref3].  It has formed the starting point for all
          other link-state protocols.  The homogeneous ARPANET
          environment, i.e., single-vendor packet switches connected by
          synchronous serial lines, simplified the design and
          implementation of the original protocol.
