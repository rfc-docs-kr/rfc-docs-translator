     If the value of the EventBufferControl property equals LockStep,
     following detection of such an event, normal handling of events is
     suspended. Any event which is subsequently detected and occurs in the
     EventBuffer Descriptor is added to the end of the EventBuffer (a FIFO
     queue), along with the time that it was detected.   The MG SHALL wait
     for a new EventsDescriptor to be loaded.  A new EventsDescriptor can
     be loaded either as the result of receiving a command with a new
     EventsDescriptor, or by activating an embedded EventsDescriptor.
