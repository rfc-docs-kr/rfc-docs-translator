          o   The cost or path type of a routing table entry has changed.
              If the destination described by this entry is a Network or
              AS boundary router, and this is not simply a change of AS
              external routes, new summary-LSAs may have to be generated
              (potentially one for each attached area, including the
              backbone).  See Section 12.4.3 for more information.  If a
              previously advertised entry has been deleted, or is no
              longer advertisable to a particular area, the LSA must be
              flushed from the routing domain by setting its LS age to
              MaxAge and reflooding (see Section 14.1).
