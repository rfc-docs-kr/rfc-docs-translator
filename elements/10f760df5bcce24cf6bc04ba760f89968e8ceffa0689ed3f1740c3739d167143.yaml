     If the host does not have an operable routable IPv4 address on any
     network, the host enters the INIT state and sends a DHCPDISCOVER
     packet to the broadcast address, as described in Section 4.4.1 of the
     DHCP specification [RFC2131].  If the host supports the Rapid Commit
     Option [RFC4039], it is possible that the exchange can be shortened
     from a 4-message exchange to a 2-message exchange.
