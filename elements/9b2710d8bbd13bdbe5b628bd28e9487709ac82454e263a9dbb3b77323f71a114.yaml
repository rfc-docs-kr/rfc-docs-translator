     There are also cases where an application needs to correlate multiple
     application sessions into a single accounting record; the accounting
     record may span multiple different Diameter applications and sessions
     used by the same user at a given time.  In such cases, the Acct-
     Multi-Session-Id AVP is used.  The Acct-Multi-Session-Id AVP SHOULD
     be signaled by the server to the access device (typically, during
     authorization) when it determines that a request belongs to an
     existing session.  The access device MUST then include the Acct-
     Multi-Session-Id AVP in all subsequent accounting messages.
