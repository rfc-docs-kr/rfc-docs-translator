     The "confirmed transaction-id ranges" values shall not be used if
     more than LONG-TIMER seconds have elapsed since the MG issued its
     last response to that MGC, or when a MG resumes operation.  In this
     situation, transactions should be accepted and processed, without
     any test on the transaction-id.
