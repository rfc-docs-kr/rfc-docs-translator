      Router ID
          A 32-bit number that uniquely identifies this router in the AS.
          One possible implementation strategy would be to use the
          smallest IP interface address belonging to the router. If a
          router's OSPF Router ID is changed, the router's OSPF software
          should be restarted before the new Router ID takes effect.  In
          this case the router should flush its self-originated LSAs from
          the routing domain (see Section 14.1) before restarting, or they
          will persist for up to MaxAge minutes.
