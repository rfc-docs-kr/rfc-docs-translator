     This section defines a set of capabilities that a client or a server
     MAY implement.  Each peer advertises its capabilities by sending them
     during an initial capabilities exchange.  Each peer needs to
     understand only those capabilities that it might use and MUST ignore
     any capability received from the other peer that it does not require
     or does not understand.
