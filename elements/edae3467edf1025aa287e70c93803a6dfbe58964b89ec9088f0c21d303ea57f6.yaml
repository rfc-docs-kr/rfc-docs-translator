          On Point-to-MultiPoint networks, it may be necessary to
          configure the set of neighbors that are directly reachable over
          the Point-to-MultiPoint network. Each neighbor is identified by
          its IP address on the Point-to-MultiPoint network. Designated
          Routers are not elected on Point-to-MultiPoint networks, so the
          Designated Router eligibility of configured neighbors is
          undefined.
