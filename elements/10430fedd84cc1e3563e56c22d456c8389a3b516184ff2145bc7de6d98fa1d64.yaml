          The first change is to step 4 in Section 13. Now MaxAge LSAs are
          acknowledged and then discarded only when both a) there is no
          database copy of the LSA and b) none of router's neighbors are
          in states Exchange or Loading. In all other cases, the MaxAge
          LSA is processed like any other LSA, installing the LSA in the
          database and flooding it out the appropriate interfaces when the
          LSA is more recent than the database copy (Step 5 of Section
          13). This change also affects the contents of Table 19.
