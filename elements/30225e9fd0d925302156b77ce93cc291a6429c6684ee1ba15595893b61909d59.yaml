        The Length field is two octets.  It indicates the length of the
        packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Authenticator, and
        Attribute fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length field
        MUST be treated as padding and ignored on reception.  If the
        packet is shorter than the Length field indicates, it MUST be
        silently discarded.  The minimum length is 20 and maximum length
        is 4096.
