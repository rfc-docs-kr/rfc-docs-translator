     The Icarus simulator [ICARUS] focuses on caching in ICN and is
     agnostic with respect to any particular ICN implementation.  The
     simulator is implemented in Python, uses the Fast Network Simulator
     Setup tool [Saino13], and is available at
     <http://icarus-sim.github.io>.  Icarus has several caching strategies
     implemented, including among others ProbCache [Psaras12], node-
     centrality-based caching [Chai12], and hash-route-based caching
     [HASHROUT].
