     A Diameter client or access device increments the value of the
     Origin-State-Id every time it is started or powered up.  The new
     Origin-State-Id is then sent in the CER/CEA message immediately upon
     connection to the server.  The Diameter server receiving the new
     Origin-State-Id can determine whether the sending Diameter client had
     abruptly shut down by comparing the old value of the Origin-State-Id
     it has kept for that specific client is less than the new value and
     whether it has un-terminated sessions originating from that client.
