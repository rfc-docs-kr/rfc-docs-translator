      This section details the OSPF routing table calculation.  Using its
      attached areas' link state databases as input, a router runs the
      following algorithm, building its routing table step by step.  At
      each step, the router must access individual pieces of the link
      state databases (e.g., a router-LSA originated by a certain router).
      This access is performed by the lookup function discussed in Section
      12.2.  The lookup process may return an LSA whose LS age is equal to
      MaxAge.  Such an LSA should not be used in the routing table
      calculation, and is treated just as if the lookup process had
      failed.
