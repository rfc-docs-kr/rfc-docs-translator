        (k)  If certificate i is a version 3 certificate, verify that the
             basicConstraints extension is present and that cA is set to
             TRUE.  (If certificate i is a version 1 or version 2
             certificate, then the application MUST either verify that
             certificate i is a CA certificate through out-of-band means
             or reject the certificate.  Conforming implementations may
             choose to reject all version 1 and version 2 intermediate
             certificates.)
