        The Length field is two octets and indicates the length of the EAP
        packet including the Code, Identifier, Length, Type, and Type-Data
        fields.  Octets outside the range of the Length field should be
        treated as Data Link Layer padding and MUST be ignored upon
        reception.  A message with the Length field set to a value larger
        than the number of received octets MUST be silently discarded.
