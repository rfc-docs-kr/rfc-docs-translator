        1.   Exhaustion of the class B network address space. One
             fundamental cause of this problem is the lack of a network
             class of a size which is appropriate for mid-sized
             organization; class C, with a maximum of 254 host
             addresses, is too small, while class B, which allows up to
             65534 addresses, is too large for most organizations.
