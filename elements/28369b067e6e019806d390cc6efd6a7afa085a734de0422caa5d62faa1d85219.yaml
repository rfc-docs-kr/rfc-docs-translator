     This document also defines an ASN.1 module for the DelegationUsage
     certificate extension in Appendix A.  IANA has registered value 95
     for "id-mod-delegated-credential-extn" in the "SMI Security for PKIX
     Module Identifier" (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0) registry.  An OID for the
     DelegationUsage certificate extension is not needed, as it is already
     assigned to the extension from Cloudflare's IANA Private Enterprise
     Number (PEN) arc.
