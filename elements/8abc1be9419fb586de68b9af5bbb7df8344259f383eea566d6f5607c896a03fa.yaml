     In the figures below, the bottom line ("----") shows two consecutive
     sequence number subspaces, with zeros indicating the beginning of
     each subspace.  The two shorter lines above it show the higher-order
     bits that apply.  The "====" represents the window.  The "****"
     represents future sequence numbers, i.e., those beyond the current
     highest sequence number authenticated (ThTl).
