          Many consistency checks have been made on a received Link State
          Acknowledgment packet before it is handed to the flooding
          procedure.  In particular, it has been associated with a
          particular neighbor.  If this neighbor is in a lesser state than
          Exchange, the Link State Acknowledgment packet is discarded.
