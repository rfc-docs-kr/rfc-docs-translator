  diffServSchedulerPriority OBJECT-IDENTITY
      STATUS       current
      DESCRIPTION
         "For use with diffServSchedulerMethod to indicate the Priority
         scheduling method.  This is defined as an algorithm in which the
         presence of data in a queue or set of queues absolutely precludes
         dequeue from another queue or set of queues of lower priority.
         Note that attributes from diffServMinRateEntry of the
         queues/schedulers feeding this scheduler are used when
         determining the next packet to schedule."
