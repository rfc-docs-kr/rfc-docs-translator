        The Type field of a Response MUST either match that of the
        Request, or correspond to a legacy or Expanded Nak (see Section
        5.3) indicating that a Request Type is unacceptable to the peer.
        A peer MUST NOT send a Nak (legacy or expanded) in response to a
        Request, after an initial non-Nak Response has been sent.  An EAP
        server receiving a Response not meeting these requirements MUST
        silently discard it.
