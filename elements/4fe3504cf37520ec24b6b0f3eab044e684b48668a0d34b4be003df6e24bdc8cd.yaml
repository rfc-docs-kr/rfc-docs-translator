          OSPF does not actively attempt to repair area partitions.  When
          an area becomes partitioned, each component simply becomes a
          separate area.  The backbone then performs routing between the
          new areas.  Some destinations reachable via intra-area routing
          before the partition will now require inter-area routing.
