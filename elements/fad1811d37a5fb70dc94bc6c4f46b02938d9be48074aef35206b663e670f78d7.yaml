     For scalability and resilience studies, there is a wide range of
     synthetic topologies, such as the Barabasi-Albert model [Barabasi99]
     and the Watts-Strogatz small-world topology [Watts98].  These allow
     experiments to be performed whilst controlling various key parameters
     (e.g., node degree).  These synthetic topologies are appropriate in
     the general case, as there are no practical assurances that a future
     information-centric network will have the same topology as any of
     today's networks.
