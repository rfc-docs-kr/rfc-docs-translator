     In Disconnect-Request and CoA-Request packets, certain attributes are
     used to uniquely identify the NAS as well as user session(s) on the
     NAS.  The combination of NAS and session identification attributes
     included in a CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request packet MUST match at
     least one session in order for a Request to be successful; otherwise
     a Disconnect-NAK or CoA-NAK MUST be sent.  If all NAS identification
     attributes match, and more than one session matches all of the
     session identification attributes, then a CoA-Request or Disconnect-
     Request MUST apply to all matching sessions.
