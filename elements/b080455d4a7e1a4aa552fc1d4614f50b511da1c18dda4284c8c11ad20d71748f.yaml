     The TransactionResponse Acknowledgement parameter can be found in
     any message. It carries a set of "confirmed transaction-id ranges".
     Entities may choose to delete the copies of the responses to
     transactions whose id is included in "confirmed transaction-id
     ranges" received in the transaction response messages. They should
     silently discard further commands when the transaction-id falls
     within these ranges.
