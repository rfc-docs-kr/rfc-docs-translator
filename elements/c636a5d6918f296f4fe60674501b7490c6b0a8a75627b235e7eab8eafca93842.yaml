          Router RT4's routing table would improve (i.e., some of the
          paths in the routing table would become shorter) if an
          additional virtual link were configured between Router RT4 and
          Router RT3.  The new virtual link would itself be associated
          with the first entry for area border router RT3 in Table 13 (an
          intra-area path through Area 1).  This would yield a cost of 1
          for the virtual link.  The routing table entries changes that
          would be caused by the addition of this virtual link are shown
