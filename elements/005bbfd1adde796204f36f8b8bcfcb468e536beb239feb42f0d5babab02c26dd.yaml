     The base Diameter protocol concerns itself with establishing
     connections to peers, capabilities negotiation, how messages are sent
     and routed through peers, and how the connections are eventually torn
     down.  The base protocol also defines certain rules that apply to all
     message exchanges between Diameter nodes.
