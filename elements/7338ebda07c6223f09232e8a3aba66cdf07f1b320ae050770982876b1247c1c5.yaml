        specific realm, but not to a specific server (such as the first
        request of a series of round trips), MUST contain a Destination-
        Realm AVP but MUST NOT contain a Destination-Host AVP.  For
        Diameter clients, the value of the Destination-Realm AVP MAY be
        extracted from the User-Name AVP, or other methods.
