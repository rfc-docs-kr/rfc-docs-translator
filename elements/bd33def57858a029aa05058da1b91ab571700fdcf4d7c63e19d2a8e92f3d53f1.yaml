     Removal of a media stream implies that media is no longer sent for
     that stream, and any media that is received is discarded.  In the
     case of RTP, RTCP transmission also ceases, as does processing of any
     received RTCP packets.  Any resources associated with it can be
     released.  The user interface might indicate that the stream has
     terminated, by closing the associated window on a PC, for example.

  미디어 스트림을 제거하면 해당 스트림에 대한 미디어가 더 이상 전송되지 않으며 수신된 모든 미디어가 삭제됩니다. RTP의 경우 RTCP 전송도 중단되고 수신된 RTCP 패킷의 처리도 중단됩니다. 이와 관련된 모든 리소스는 해제될 수 있습니다. 사용자 인터페이스는 예를 들어 PC에서 관련 창을 닫아 스트림이 종료되었음을 나타낼 수 있습니다.
