          In addition, a non-decreasing sequence number is included in
          each OSPF protocol packet to protect against replay attacks.
          This provides long term protection; however, it is still
          possible to replay an OSPF packet until the sequence number
          changes. To implement this feature, each neighbor data structure
          contains a new field called the "cryptographic sequence number".
          This field is initialized to zero, and is also set to zero
