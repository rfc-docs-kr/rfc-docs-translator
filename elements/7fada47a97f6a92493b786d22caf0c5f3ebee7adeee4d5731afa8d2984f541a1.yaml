     Figure 7 provides an example of a message forwarded upstream by a
     Diameter relay.  When the message is received by Relay 2, and it
     detects that it cannot forward the request to the home server, an
     answer message is returned with the 'E' bit set and the Result-Code
     AVP set to DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_DELIVER.  Given that this error falls
     within the protocol error category, Relay 1 would take special
     action, and given the error, attempt to route the message through its
     alternate Relay 3.
