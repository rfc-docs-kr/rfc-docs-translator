           The presence of a Routing Information Field is indicated by the
           Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the source address, called the
           Routing Information Indicator (RII).  If the RII equals zero, a
           RIF is not present.  If the RII equals 1, the RIF is present.
           Although the RII is indicated in the source address, it is not
           part of a stations MAC layer address.  In particular, the MSB
           of a destination address is the individual/group address
           indicator, and if set will cause such frames to be interpreted
           as multicasts.  Implementations should be careful to reset the
           RII to zero before passing source addresses to other protocol
           layers which may be confused by their presence.
