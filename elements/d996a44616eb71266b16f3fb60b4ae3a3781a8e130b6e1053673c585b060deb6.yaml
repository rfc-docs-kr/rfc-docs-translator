                      RTA and RTB would originate the same set of AS-
                      external-LSAs.  These LSAs, if they specify the same
                      metric, would be functionally equivalent since they
                      would specify the same destination and forwarding
                      address (RTX).  This leads to a clear duplication of
                      effort.  If only one of RTA or RTB originated the
                      set of AS-external-LSAs, the routing would remain
                      the same, and the size of the link state database
                      would decrease.  However, it must be unambiguously
                      defined as to which router originates the LSAs
                      (otherwise neither may, or the identity of the
                      originator may oscillate).  The following rule is
                      thereby established: if two routers, both reachable
                      from one another, originate functionally equivalent
                      AS-external-LSAs (i.e., same destination, cost and
                      non-zero forwarding address), then the LSA
                      originated by the router having the highest OSPF
                      Router ID is used.  The router having the lower OSPF
                      Router ID can then flush its LSA.  Flushing an LSA
                      is discussed in Section 14.1.
