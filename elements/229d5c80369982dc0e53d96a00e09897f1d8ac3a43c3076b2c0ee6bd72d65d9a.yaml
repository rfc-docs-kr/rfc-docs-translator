     These two rules are related; the closure of connection on completion
     of ICE implies that a regular selection algorithm has to be used.
     This is because aggressive selection might cause transient pairs to
     be selected.  Once such a pair is selected, the agents would close
     the other connections, one of which may be about to be selected as a
     better choice.  This race condition may result in TCP connections
     being accidentally closed for the pair that ICE selects.
