          The Hello packet's Options field describes the router's optional
          OSPF capabilities.  One optional capability is defined in this
          specification (see Sections 4.5 and A.2).  The E-bit of the
          Options field should be set if and only if the attached area is
          capable of processing AS-external-LSAs (i.e., it is not a stub
          area).  If the E-bit is set incorrectly the neighboring routers
          will refuse to accept the Hello Packet (see Section 10.5).
          Unrecognized bits in the Hello Packet's Options field should be
          set to zero.
