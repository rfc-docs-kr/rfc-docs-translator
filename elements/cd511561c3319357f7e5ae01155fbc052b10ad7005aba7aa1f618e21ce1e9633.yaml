      MaxAge
          The maximum age that an LSA can attain. When an LSA's LS age
          field reaches MaxAge, it is reflooded in an attempt to flush the
          LSA from the routing domain (See Section 14). LSAs of age MaxAge
          are not used in the routing table calculation.  The value of
          MaxAge is set to 1 hour.
