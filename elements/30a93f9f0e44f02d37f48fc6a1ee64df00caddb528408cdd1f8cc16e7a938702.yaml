     Diameter request message routing is done via realms and Application
     Ids. A Diameter message that may be forwarded by Diameter agents
     (proxies, redirect agents, or relay agents) MUST include the target
     realm in the Destination-Realm AVP.  Request routing SHOULD rely on
     the Destination-Realm AVP and the Application Id present in the
     request message header to aid in the routing decision.  The realm MAY
     be retrieved from the User-Name AVP, which is in the form of a
     Network Access Identifier (NAI).  The realm portion of the NAI is
     inserted in the Destination-Realm AVP.
