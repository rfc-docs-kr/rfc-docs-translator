     Diameter implementations SHOULD be able to interpret ICMP protocol
     port unreachable messages as explicit indications that the server is
     not reachable, subject to security policy on trusting such messages.
     Further guidance regarding the treatment of ICMP errors can be found
     in [RFC5927] and [RFC5461].  Diameter implementations SHOULD also be
     able to interpret a reset from the transport and timed-out connection
     attempts.  If Diameter receives data from the lower layer that cannot
     be parsed or identified as a Diameter error made by the peer, the
     stream is compromised and cannot be recovered.  The transport
     connection MUST be closed using a RESET call (send a TCP RST bit) or
     an SCTP ABORT message (graceful closure is compromised).
