     A Stream descriptor specifies the parameters of a single bi-
     directional stream.  These parameters are structured into three
     descriptors: one that contains termination properties specific to a
     stream and one each for local and remote flows. The Stream Descriptor
     includes a StreamID which identifies the stream.  Streams are created
     by specifying a new StreamID on one of the terminations in a Context.
     A stream is deleted by setting empty Local and Remote descriptors for
     the stream with ReserveGroup and ReserveValue in LocalControl set to
     "false" on all terminations in the context that previously supported
     that stream.
