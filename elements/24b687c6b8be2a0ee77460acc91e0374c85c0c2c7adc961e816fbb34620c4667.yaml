     In either case, when a DHCPLEASEUNASSIGNED or DHCPLEASEACTIVE message
     is received in response to a DHCPLEASEQUERY message, it means that
     the DHCP server that responded is a DHCP server that manages the IP
     address present in the ciaddr, and the Relay Agent SHOULD cache this
     information for later use.

  두 경우 모두 DHCPLEASEUNASSIGNED 또는 DHCPLEASEACTIVE 메시지가 DHCPLEASEQUERY 메시지에 대한 응답으로 수신되면 응답한 DHCP 서버가 ciaddr에 있는 IP 주소를 관리하는 DHCP 서버이고 Relay Agent가 이 정보를 캐시해야 함을 의미합니다. 나중에 사용하세요.
