     The allocation of AVP values for other AVPs is guided by the IANA
     considerations of the document that defines those AVPs.  Typically,
     allocation of new values for an AVP defined in an RFC would require
     IETF Review [RFC5226], whereas values for vendor-specific AVPs can be
     allocated by the vendor.
