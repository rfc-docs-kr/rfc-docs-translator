     If the SGP determines that the requested RK partially, but not
     exactly, matches an existing RK, and that an incoming signalling
     message received at an SGP could possibly match both the requested
     and the existing RK, the SGP returns a Registration Response message
     to the ASP, with a Registration Status of "Error - "Cannot Support
     Unique Routing".  An incoming signalling message received at an SGP
     should not match against more than one Routing Key.
