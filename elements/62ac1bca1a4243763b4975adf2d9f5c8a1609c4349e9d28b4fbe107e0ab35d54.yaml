     The multiuser/multikey security of AES-GCM-SIV was studied by
     [BHT18], which showed that security is almost the same as in the
     single-user setting, as long as nonces do not repeat many times
     across many users.  This is the case when nonces are chosen randomly.

  AES-GCM-SIV의 다중 사용자/다중 키 보안은 [BHT18]에 의해 연구되었으며, 이는 nonce가 여러 사용자에 걸쳐 여러 번 반복되지 않는 한 보안이 단일 사용자 설정과 거의 동일하다는 것을 보여줍니다. 이는 nonce가 무작위로 선택되는 경우입니다.
