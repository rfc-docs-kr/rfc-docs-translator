     Each event in the descriptor contains the Event name, an optional
     streamID, an optional KeepActive flag, and optional parameters.  The
     Event name consists of a Package Name (where the event is defined)
     and an EventID. The ALL wildcard may be used for the EventID,
     indicating that all events from the specified package have to be
     detected.  The default streamID is 0, indicating that the event to be
     detected is not related to a particular media stream.  Events can
     have parameters.  This allows a single event description to have some
     variation in meaning without creating large numbers of individual
     events.  Further event parameters are defined in the package.
