     Each block of ChaCha20 involves 16 move operations and one increment
     operation for loading the state, 80 each of XOR, addition and Roll
     operations for the rounds, 16 more add operations and 16 XOR
     operations for protecting the plaintext.  Section 2.3 describes the
     ChaCha block function as "adding the original input words".  This
     implies that before starting the rounds on the ChaCha state, we copy
     it aside, only to add it in later.  This is correct, but we can save
     a few operations if we instead copy the state and do the work on the
     copy.  This way, for the next block you don't need to recreate the
     state, but only to increment the block counter.  This saves
     approximately 5.5% of the cycles.
