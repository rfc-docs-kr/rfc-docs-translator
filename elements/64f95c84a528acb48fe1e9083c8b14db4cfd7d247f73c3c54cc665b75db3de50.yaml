     Diameter agents MAY have a list of locally supported realms and
     applications, and they MAY have a list of externally supported realms
     and applications.  When a request is received that includes a realm
     and/or application that is not locally supported, the message is
     routed to the peer configured in the routing table (see Section 2.7).
