     The sender behavior is determined by the configuration of the
     Session-Sender and is not defined in this standard.  Further, the
     Session-Reflector does not need to know the Session-Sender behavior
     to the degree of detail as needed in OWAMP [RFC4656].  Additionally,
     the Session-Sender collects and records the necessary information
     provided from the packets transmitted by the Session-Reflector for
     measuring two-way metrics.  The information recording based on the
     packet(s) received by the Session-Sender is implementation dependent.
