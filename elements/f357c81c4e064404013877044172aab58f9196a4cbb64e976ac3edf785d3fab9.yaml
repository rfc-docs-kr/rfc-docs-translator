     If the onramp gateway fails in the transmission of the return notice
     back to GSTN fax service, the information MAY be recorded into a log,
     and processing MAY end.  As an alternate, the administrator of the
     gateway system MAY be notified of this notice with a specific method
     (for example, by sending an e-mail message to a mailbox).
