     o  Deprecated the exchange of CER/CEA messages in the open state.
        This feature was implied in the peer state machine table of RFC
        3588, but it was not clearly defined anywhere else in that
        document.  As work on this document progressed, it became clear
        that the multiplicity of meaning and use of Application-Id AVPs in
        the CER/CEA messages (and the messages themselves) is seen as an
        abuse of the Diameter extensibility rules and thus required
        simplification.  Capabilities exchange in the open state has been
        re-introduced in a separate specification [RFC6737], which clearly
        defines new commands for this feature.
