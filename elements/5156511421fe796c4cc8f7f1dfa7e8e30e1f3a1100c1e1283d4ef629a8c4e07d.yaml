              o   Database Description packets must be processed in
                  sequence, as indicated by the packets' DD sequence
                  numbers. If the router is master, the next packet
                  received should have DD sequence number equal to the DD
                  sequence number in the neighbor data structure. If the
                  router is slave, the next packet received should have DD
                  sequence number equal to one more than the DD sequence
                  number stored in the neighbor data structure. In either
                  case, if the packet is the next in sequence it should be
                  accepted and its contents processed as specified below.
