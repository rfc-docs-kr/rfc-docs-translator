     If an agent is utilizing SRTP [RFC3711], it MAY include a mix of UDP
     and TCP candidates.  If ICE selects a TCP candidate pair, it is
     RECOMMENDED that the agent still utilizes SRTP but runs it over the
     connection established by ICE.  The alternative, RTP over TLS, breaks
     RTP header compression and on-path RTP analysis tools and hence
     SHOULD be avoided.  In the case of DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764], the
     directionality attributes (a=setup) are utilized strictly to
     determine the direction of the DTLS handshake.  Directionality of the
     TCP connection establishment is determined by the ICE attributes and
     procedures defined here.
