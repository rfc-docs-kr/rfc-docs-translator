     As the Internet started to expand rapidly in the 1990s, it became
     clear that a single, centralized address assignment authority was
     problematic.  This function began being de-centralized when address
     space assignment for European Internet sites was delegated in bit-
     aligned blocks of 16777216 addresses (what CIDR would later define as
     a /8) to the RIPE NCC ([RIPE]), effectively making it the first of
     the RIRs.  Since then, address assignment has been formally
     distributed as a hierarchical function with IANA, the RIRs, and the
     service providers.  Removing the bottleneck of a single organization
     having responsibility for the global Internet address space greatly
     improved the efficiency and response time for new assignments.
