          The OSPF protocol runs directly over IP, using IP protocol 89.
          OSPF does not provide any explicit fragmentation/reassembly
          support.  When fragmentation is necessary, IP
          fragmentation/reassembly is used.  OSPF protocol packets have
          been designed so that large protocol packets can generally be
          split into several smaller protocol packets.  This practice is
          recommended; IP fragmentation should be avoided whenever
          possible.
