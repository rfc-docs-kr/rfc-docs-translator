     Implementation Note: Where more than one route (or SGP) is possible
     for routing to the SS7 network, the ASP could, for example, maintain
     a dynamic table of available SGP routes for the SS7 destinations,
     taking into account the SS7 destination
     availability/restricted/congestion status received from the SGP(s),
     the availability status of the individual SGPs, and configuration
     changes and failover mechanisms.  There is, however, no M3UA
     messaging to manage the status of an SGP (e.g., SGP-
     Up/Down/Active/Inactive messaging).
