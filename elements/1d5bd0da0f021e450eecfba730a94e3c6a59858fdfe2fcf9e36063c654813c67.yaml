     Connection or session flows are different from packet flows.  A
     session flow  indicates the direction in which the session was
     initiated with reference to a network interface. Packet flow is the
     direction in which the packet has traveled with reference to a
     network interface. Take for example, an outbound telnet session.  The
     telnet session consists of packet flows in both inbound and outbound
     directions. Outbound telnet packets carry terminal keystrokes and
     inbound telnet packets carry screen displays from the telnet server.
