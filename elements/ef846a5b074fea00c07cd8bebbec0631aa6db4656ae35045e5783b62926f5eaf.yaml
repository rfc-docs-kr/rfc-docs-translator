     The SGP examines the contents of the received Routing Key parameter
     and compares it with the currently provisioned Routing Keys.  If the
     received Routing Key matches an existing SGP Routing Key entry and
     the ASP is not currently included in the list of ASPs for the related
     Application Server, the SGP MAY authorize the ASP to be added to the
     AS.  Or, if the Routing Key does not currently exist and the received
     Routing Key data is valid and unique, an SGP supporting dynamic
     configuration MAY authorize the creation of a new Routing Key and
     related Application Server and add the ASP to the new AS.  In either
     case, the SGP returns a Registration Response message to the ASP,
     containing the same Local-RK-Identifier as provided in the initial
     request, and a Registration Result "Successfully Registered".  A
     unique Routing Context value assigned to the SGP Routing Key is
     included.  The method of Routing Context value assignment at the SGP
     is implementation dependent but must be guaranteed to be unique for
     each Application Server or Routing Key supported by the SGP.
