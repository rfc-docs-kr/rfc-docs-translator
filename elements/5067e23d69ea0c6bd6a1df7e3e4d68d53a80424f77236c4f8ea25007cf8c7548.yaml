     Within the framework architecture, this document defines an MTP3-User
     adaptation module suitable for supporting the transfer of messages of
     any protocol layer that is identified to the MTP Level 3 as an MTP
     User.  The list of these protocol layers includes but is not limited
     to ISDN User Part (ISUP) [1,2,3], Signalling Connection Control Part
     (SCCP) [4,5,6], and Telephone User Part (TUP) [13].  TCAP [14,15,16]
     or RANAP [16] messages are transferred transparently by the M3UA
     protocol as SCCP payload, as they are SCCP-User protocols.
