     The Authorization-Lifetime AVP (AVP Code 291) is of type Unsigned32
     and contains the maximum number of seconds of service to be provided
     to the user before the user is to be re-authenticated and/or re-
     authorized.  Care should be taken when the Authorization-Lifetime
     value is determined, since a low, non-zero value could create
     significant Diameter traffic, which could congest both the network
     and the agents.
