          When no OSPF areas are configured, each router in the Autonomous
          System has an identical link-state database, leading to an
          identical graphical representation.  A router generates its
          routing table from this graph by calculating a tree of shortest
          paths with the router itself as root.  Obviously, the shortest-
          path tree depends on the router doing the calculation.  The
          shortest-path tree for Router RT6 in our example is depicted in
          Figure 5.
