     This memo describes the use of IP and ARP on the three types of
     networks.  At this time, it is not necessary that the use of IP and
     ARP be consistent across all three types of networks, only that it be
     consistent within each type.  This may change in the future as new
     IEEE 802 standards are defined and the existing standards are revised
