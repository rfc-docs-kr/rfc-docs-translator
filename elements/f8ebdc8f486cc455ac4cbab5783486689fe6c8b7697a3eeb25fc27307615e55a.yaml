     For weighted scheduling methods, such as WFQ or WRR, the "weight" of
     a given scheduler input is represented with a Minimum Service Rate
     leaky-bucket profile which provides a guaranteed minimum bandwidth to
     that input, if required.  This is represented by a rate
     diffServMinRateAbsolute; the classical weight is the ratio between
     that rate and the interface speed, or perhaps the ratio between that
     rate and the sum of the configured rates for classes.  The rate may
     be represented by a relative value, as a fraction of the interface's
     current line rate, diffServMinRateRelative, to assist in cases where
     line rates are variable or where a higher-level policy might be
     expressed in terms of fractions of network resources.  The two rate
     parameters are inter-related and changes in one may be reflected in
     the other.  An example is found in figure 3.
