     Traffic that exceeded the arrival policy, however, is to be dropped.
     One can use a count action on this traffic if the several counters
     are interesting.  However, since the drop counter in the Algorithmic
     Drop Entry will count packets dropped, this is not clearly necessary.
     An Algorithmic Drop Entry of the type "alwaysDrop" with no successor
     is sufficient.
