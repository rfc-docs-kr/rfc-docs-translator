     The Failed-AVP AVP (AVP Code 279) is of type Grouped and provides
     debugging information in cases where a request is rejected or not
     fully processed due to erroneous information in a specific AVP.  The
     value of the Result-Code AVP will provide information on the reason
     for the Failed-AVP AVP.  A Diameter answer message SHOULD contain an
     instance of the Failed-AVP AVP that corresponds to the error
     indicated by the Result-Code AVP.  For practical purposes, this
     Failed-AVP would typically refer to the first AVP processing error
     that a Diameter node encounters.
