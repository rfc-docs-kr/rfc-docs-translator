                    For example, consider a valid_policy_tree with a node
                    of depth i-1 where the valid_policy is anyPolicy.
                    Assume the certificate policies Gold and Silver appear
                    in the certificate policies extension of certificate
                    i.  The Gold policy does not have a qualifier, but the
                    Silver policy has the qualifier Q-Silver.  If Gold and
                    Silver were not matched in (i) above, this rule will
                    generate two child nodes of depth i, one for each
                    policy.  The result is shown as Figure 5.
