     Note: The rule about including the UID message data item as part of a
     FETCH response primarily applies to the UID FETCH and UID STORE
     commands, including a UID FETCH command that does not include UID as
     a message data item.  Although it is unlikely that the other UID
     commands will cause an untagged FETCH, this rule applies to these
     commands as well.

  참고: UID 메시지 데이터 항목을 FETCH 응답의 일부로 포함하는 규칙은 주로 UID를 메시지 데이터 항목으로 포함하지 않는 UID FETCH 명령을 포함하여 UID FETCH 및 UID STORE 명령에 적용됩니다.  다른 UID 명령으로 인해 태그가 지정되지 않은 FETCH가 발생할 가능성은 없지만 이 규칙은 이러한 명령에도 적용됩니다.
