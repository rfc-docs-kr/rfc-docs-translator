     For the particular case that an ASP becomes active for an AS and
     destinations normally accessible to the AS are inaccessible,
     restricted, or congested, the SG MAY send DUNA, DRST, or SCON
     messages for the inaccessible, restricted, or congested destinations
     to the ASP newly active for the AS to prevent the ASP from sending
     traffic for destinations that it might not otherwise know that are
     inaccessible, restricted, or congested.  For the newly activating ASP
     from which the SGP has received an ASP Active message, these DUNA,
     DRST, and SCON messages MAY be sent before sending the ASP Active Ack
     that completes the activation procedure.
