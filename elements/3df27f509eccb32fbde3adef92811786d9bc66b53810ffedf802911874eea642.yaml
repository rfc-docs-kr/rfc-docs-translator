              DISCUSSION:
                   This procedure minimizes delay if the zero-window
                   condition is due to a lost ACK segment containing a
                   window-opening update.  Exponential backoff is
                   recommended, possibly with some maximum interval not
                   specified here.  This procedure is similar to that of
                   the retransmission algorithm, and it may be possible to
                   combine the two procedures in the implementation.
