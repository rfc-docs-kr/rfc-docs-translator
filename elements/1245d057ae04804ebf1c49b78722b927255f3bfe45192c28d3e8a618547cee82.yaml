     Finally, it should also be noted that deployment of the new
     addressing plan described in this document may (and should) begin
     almost immediately but effective use of the plan to aggregate routing
     information will require changes to some Inter-Domain routing
     protocols. Likewise, deploying classless Inter-Domain protocols
     without deployment of the new address plan will not allow useful
     aggregation to occur (in other words, the addressing plan and routing
     protocol changes are both required for supernetting, and its
     resulting reduction in table growth, to be effective.)  Note,
     however, that during the period of time between deployment of the
     addressing plan and deployment of the new protocols, the size of
     routing tables may temporarily grow very rapidly. This must be
     considered when planning the deployment of the two plans.
