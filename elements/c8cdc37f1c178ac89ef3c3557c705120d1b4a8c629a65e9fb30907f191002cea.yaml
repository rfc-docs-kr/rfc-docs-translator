     Routing Keys SHOULD be unique in the sense that each received SS7
     signalling message SHOULD have a full or partial match to a single
     routing result.  An example of a partial match would be a default
     Routing Key that would be the result if there are no other Routing
     Keys to which the message belongs.  It is not necessary for the
     parameter range values within a particular Routing Key to be
     contiguous.
