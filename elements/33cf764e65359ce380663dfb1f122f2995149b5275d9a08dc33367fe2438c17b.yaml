     Deployment of CIDR, in combination with BGP4's support for carrying
     classless prefix routes, alleviated the short-term crisis.  It was
     only through a concerted effort by both the equipment manufacturers
     and the provider community that this was achieved.  The threat (and,
     perhaps in some cases, actual implementation of) charging networks
     for advertising prefixes may have offered an additional incentive to
     share the address space, and thus the associated costs of advertising
     routes to service providers.
