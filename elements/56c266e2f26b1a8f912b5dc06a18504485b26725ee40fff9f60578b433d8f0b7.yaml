     Implementation Note: Canvel et al. [CBCTIME] have demonstrated a
                          timing attack on CBC padding based on the time
                          required to compute the MAC.  In order to defend
                          against this attack, implementations MUST ensure
                          that record processing time is essentially the
                          same whether or not the padding is correct.  In
                          general, the best way to do this is to compute
                          the MAC even if the padding is incorrect, and
                          only then reject the packet.  For instance, if
                          the pad appears to be incorrect, the
                          implementation might assume a zero-length pad
                          and then compute the MAC.  This leaves a small
                          timing channel, since MAC performance depends to
                          some extent on the size of the data fragment,
