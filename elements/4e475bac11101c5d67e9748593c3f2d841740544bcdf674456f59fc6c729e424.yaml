     At a higher level of abstraction, we could measure the network's
     transport performance at the application output.  This entails
     measuring the quality of the transported and reconstructed
     information as perceived by the user during consumption.  In such an
     instance we would use Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics, which are
     by definition dependent on the application.  For example, the
     standardized methods for obtaining a Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for
     VoIP (e.g., ITU-T Recommendation P.800) is quite different from those
     for IPTV (e.g., Perceptual Evaluation of Video Quality (PEVQ)).
     These methods are notoriously hard to implement, as they involve real
     users in a controlled environment.  Such constraints can be relaxed
     or dropped by using methods that model human perception under certain
     environments, but these methods are typically intrusive.  The most
     important drawback of measuring network performance at the output of
     the application is that only one part of each measurement is related
     to network performance.  The rest is related to application
     performance, e.g., video coding, or even device capabilities, both of
     which are irrelevant to our purposes here and are generally hard to
     separate.  We therefore see the use of QoE metrics in measuring ICN
     performance as a poor choice at this stage.
