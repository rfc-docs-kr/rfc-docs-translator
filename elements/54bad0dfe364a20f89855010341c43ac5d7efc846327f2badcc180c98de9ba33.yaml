     As with any IP-based protocol, in some circumstances a receiver may
     be overloaded simply by the receipt of too many packets, either
     desired or undesired.  Network-layer authentication may be used to
     discard packets from undesired sources, but the processing cost of
     the authentication itself may be too high.  In a multicast
     environment, pruning of specific sources will be implemented in a
     future version of IGMP [8] and in multicast routing protocols to
     allow a receiver to select which sources are allowed to reach it.
