     AS-PENDING: An active ASP has transitioned to ASP-INACTIVE or ASP
     DOWN and it was the last remaining active ASP in the AS.  A recovery
     timer T(r) SHOULD be started, and all incoming signalling messages
     SHOULD be queued by the SGP.  If an ASP becomes ASP-ACTIVE before
     T(r) expires, the AS is moved to the AS-ACTIVE state, and all the
     queued messages will be sent to the ASP.
