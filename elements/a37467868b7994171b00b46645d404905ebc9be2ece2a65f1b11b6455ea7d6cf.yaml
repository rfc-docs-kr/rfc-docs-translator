     There have been several practical attacks on TLS when used with RSA
     certificates (the most common use case).  These include
     [Bleichenbacher98] and [Klima03].  While the Bleichenbacher attack
     has been mitigated in TLS 1.0, the Klima attack, which relies on a
     version-check oracle, is only mitigated by TLS 1.1.
