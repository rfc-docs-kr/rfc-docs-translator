     No recommendation is made on how the MGCs involved in the Handoff
     maintain state information; this is considered to be out of scope of
     this recommendation. The MGC and MG may take the following steps when
     Handoff occurs.  When the MGC initiates a HandOff, the handover
     should be transparent to Operations on the Media Gateway.
     Transactions can be executed in any order, and could be in progress
     when the ServiceChange is executed.  Accordingly, commands in
     progress continue, transaction replies are sent to the new MGC (after
     a new control association is established), and the MG should expect
     outstanding transaction replies from the new MGC.  No new messages
     shall be sent to the new MGC until the control association is
     established.  Repeated transaction requests shall be directed to the
     new MGC.  The MG shall maintain state on all terminations and
     contexts.
