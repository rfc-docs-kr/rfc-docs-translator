          (3) If at this step the candidate list is empty, the shortest-
              path tree (of transit vertices) has been completely built
              and this stage of the procedure terminates.  Otherwise,
              choose the vertex belonging to the candidate list that is
              closest to the root, and add it to the shortest-path tree
              (removing it from the candidate list in the process). Note
              that when there is a choice of vertices closest to the root,
              network vertices must be chosen before router vertices in
              order to necessarily find all equal-cost paths. This is
              consistent with the tie-breakers that were introduced in the
              modified Dijkstra algorithm used by OSPF's Multicast routing
              extensions (MOSPF).
