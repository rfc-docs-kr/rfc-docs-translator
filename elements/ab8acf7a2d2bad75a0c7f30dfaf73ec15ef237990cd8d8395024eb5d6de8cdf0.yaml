     Allowing for dynamic Diameter agent discovery makes possible simpler
     and more robust deployment of Diameter services.  In order to promote
     interoperable implementations of Diameter peer discovery, the
     following mechanisms (manual configuration and DNS) are described.
     These are based on existing IETF standards.  Both mechanisms MUST be
     supported by all Diameter implementations; either MAY be used.
