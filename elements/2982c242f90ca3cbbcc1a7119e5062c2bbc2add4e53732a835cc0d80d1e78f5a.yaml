     Each AVP of type OctetString MUST be padded to align on a 32-bit
     boundary, while other AVP types align naturally.  A number of zero-
     valued bytes are added to the end of the AVP Data field until a word
     boundary is reached.  The length of the padding is not reflected in
     the AVP Length field.
