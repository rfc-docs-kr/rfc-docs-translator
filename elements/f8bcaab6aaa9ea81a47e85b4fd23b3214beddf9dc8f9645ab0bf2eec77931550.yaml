                   Note that the Nagle algorithm and the send SWS
                   avoidance algorithm play complementary roles in
                   improving performance.  The Nagle algorithm discourages
                   sending tiny segments when the data to be sent
                   increases in small increments, while the SWS avoidance
                   algorithm discourages small segments resulting from the
                   right window edge advancing in small increments.
