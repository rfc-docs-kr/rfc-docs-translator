        A Diameter client is a Diameter node that supports Diameter client
        applications as well as the base protocol.  Diameter clients are
        often implemented in devices situated at the edge of a network and
        provide access control services for that network.  Typical
        examples of Diameter clients include the Network Access Server
        (NAS) and the Mobile IP Foreign Agent (FA).
