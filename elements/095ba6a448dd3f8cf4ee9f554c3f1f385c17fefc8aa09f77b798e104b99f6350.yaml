     Erroneous application of ECN-CE markings by the network can result in
     degraded connection performance.  An endpoint that receives an ACK
     frame with ECN counts therefore validates the counts before using
     them.  It performs this validation by comparing newly received counts
     against those from the last successfully processed ACK frame.  Any
     increase in the ECN counts is validated based on the ECN markings
     that were applied to packets that are newly acknowledged in the ACK
     frame.

  네트워크에서 ECN-CE 표시를 잘못 적용하면 연결 성능이 저하될 수 있습니다. 따라서 ECN 카운트가 포함된 ACK 프레임을 수신하는 엔드포인트는 이를 사용하기 전에 카운트를 검증합니다. 새로 수신된 개수를 마지막으로 성공적으로 처리된 ACK 프레임의 개수와 비교하여 이 유효성 검사를 수행합니다. ECN 수의 증가는 ACK 프레임에서 새로 승인된 패킷에 적용된 ECN 표시를 기반으로 검증됩니다.
