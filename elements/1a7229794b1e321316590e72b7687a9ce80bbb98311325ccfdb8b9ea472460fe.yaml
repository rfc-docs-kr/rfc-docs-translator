     If timer H fires while in the "Completed" state, it implies that the
     ACK was never received.  In this case, the server transaction MUST
     transition to the "Terminated" state, and MUST indicate to the TU
     that a transaction failure has occurred.

  "완료" 상태에 있는 동안 타이머 H가 실행되면 이는 ACK가 수신되지 않았음을 의미합니다. 이 경우, 서버 트랜잭션은 "Terminating" 상태로 전환되어야 하며(MUST) 트랜잭션 실패가 발생했음을 TU에 표시해야 합니다.
