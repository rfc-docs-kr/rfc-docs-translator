     Number of Sessions MUST contain the number of send sessions started
     by the Control-Client that have not been previously terminated by a
     Stop-Sessions command (i.e., the Control-Client MUST account for each
     accepted Request-Session).  If the Stop-Sessions message does not
     account for exactly the number of sessions in progress, then it is to
     be considered invalid, the TWAMP-Control connection SHOULD be closed,
     and any results obtained considered invalid.
