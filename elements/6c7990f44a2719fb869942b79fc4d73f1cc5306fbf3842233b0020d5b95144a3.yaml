        IEEE 802 packets may have a minimum size restriction.  When
        necessary, the data field should be padded (with octets of zero)
        to meet the IEEE 802 minimum frame size requirements.  This
        padding is not part of the IP datagram and is not included in the
        total length field of the IP header.
