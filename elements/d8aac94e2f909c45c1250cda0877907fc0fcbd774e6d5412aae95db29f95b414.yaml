     A good-faith implementation of the protocols that was produced after
     careful reading of the RFC's and with some interaction with the
     Internet technical community, and that followed good communications
     software engineering practices, should differ from the requirements
     of this document in only minor ways.  Thus, in many cases, the
     "requirements" in this RFC are already stated or implied in the
     standard protocol documents, so that their inclusion here is, in a
     sense, redundant.  However, they were included because some past
     implementation has made the wrong choice, causing problems of
     interoperability, performance, and/or robustness.

  RFC를 주의 깊게 읽고 인터넷 기술 커뮤니티와의 일부 상호 작용을 통해 생성되었으며 올바른 통신 소프트웨어 엔지니어링 관행을 따른 프로토콜의 선의의 구현은 이 문서의 요구 사항과 약간만 다를 수 있습니다. 따라서 많은 경우에 이 RFC의 "요구 사항"은 이미 표준 프로토콜 문서에 명시되거나 암시되어 있으므로 여기에 포함시키는 것은 어떤 의미에서는 중복됩니다. 그러나 과거의 일부 구현이 잘못된 선택을 하여 상호 운용성, 성능 및/또는 견고성에 문제를 일으켰기 때문에 포함되었습니다.
