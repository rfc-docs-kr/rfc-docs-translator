     A good-faith implementation of the protocols that was produced after
     careful reading of the RFC's and with some interaction with the
     Internet technical community, and that followed good communications
     software engineering practices, should differ from the requirements
     of this document in only minor ways.  Thus, in many cases, the
     "requirements" in this RFC are already stated or implied in the
     standard protocol documents, so that their inclusion here is, in a
     sense, redundant.  However, they were included because some past
     implementation has made the wrong choice, causing problems of
     interoperability, performance, and/or robustness.
