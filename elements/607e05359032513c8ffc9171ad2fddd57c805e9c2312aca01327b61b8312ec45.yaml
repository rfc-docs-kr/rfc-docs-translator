     The offramp gateway SHOULD also have a function to apply translation
     to originator addresses and other addresses referred to into the
     Internet Fax, in order to ensure a possible return path from GSTN fax
     service to Internet Fax destinations, including other offramp
     gateways.  These functions MUST be compliant with the address
     handling of onramp gateways that is described in Section 4.2 of this
