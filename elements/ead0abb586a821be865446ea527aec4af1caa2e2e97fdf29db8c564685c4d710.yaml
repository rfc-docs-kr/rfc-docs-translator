   Warning: The seeding functions in RSAREF and versions of BSAFE prior to
            3.0 are order-independent. For example, if 1000 seed bits are
            supplied, one at a time, in 1000 separate calls to the seed
            function, the PRNG will end up in a state which depends only
            on the number of 0 or 1 seed bits in the seed data (i.e.,
            there are 1001 possible final states). Applications using
            BSAFE or RSAREF must take extra care to ensure proper seeding.
            This may be accomplished by accumulating seed bits into a
            buffer and processing them all at once or by processing an
            incrementing counter with every seed bit; either method will
            reintroduce order dependence into the seeding process.
