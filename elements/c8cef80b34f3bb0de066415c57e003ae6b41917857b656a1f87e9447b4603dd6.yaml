     *  That cache entry includes a Date value which is at least one
        second after the Last-Modified value and the cache has reason to
        believe that they were generated by the same clock or that there
        is enough difference between the Last-Modified and Date values to
        make clock synchronization issues unlikely.

  * 해당 캐시 항목에는 Last-Modified 값보다 최소 1초 이후의 Date 값이 포함되어 있으며 캐시는 해당 값이 동일한 시계에 의해 생성되었거나 Last-Modified와 Date 값 사이에 충분한 차이가 있다고 믿을 만한 이유가 있습니다. 시계 동기화 문제가 발생하지 않도록 합니다.
