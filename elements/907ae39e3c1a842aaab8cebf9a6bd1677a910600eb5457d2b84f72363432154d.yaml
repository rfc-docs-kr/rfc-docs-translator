          The calculation proceeds as follows. All the transit areas'
          summary-LSAs are examined in turn.  Each such summary-LSA
          describes a route through a transit area Area A to a Network N
          (N's address is obtained by masking the LSA's Link State ID with
          the network/subnet mask contained in the body of the LSA) or in
          the case of a Type 4 summary-LSA, to an AS boundary router N.
          Suppose also that the summary-LSA was originated by an area
          border router BR.
