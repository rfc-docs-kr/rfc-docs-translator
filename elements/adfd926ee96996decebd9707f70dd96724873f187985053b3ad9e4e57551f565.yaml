        Zero-homed routing domains can be considered as the degenerate
        case of routing domains with private links, as discussed in the
        previous section, and do not pose a problem for inter-domain
        routing. As above, the routing information exchanged across the
        private links sees very limited distribution, usually only to the
        routing domain at the other end of the link. Thus, there are no
        address abstraction requirements beyond those inherent in the
        address prefixes exchanged across the private link.
