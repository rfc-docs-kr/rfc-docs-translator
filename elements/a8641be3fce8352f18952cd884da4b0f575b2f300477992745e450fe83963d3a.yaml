     An SGP or IPSP, upon receipt of an ASP Active message for the first
     ASP in a Broadcast AS, MAY choose not to direct traffic to a newly
     active ASP until it determines that there are sufficient resources to
     handle the expected load (e.g., until there are "n" ASPs in state
     ASP-ACTIVE in the AS).  In this case, the SGP or IPSP SHOULD withhold
     the Notify (AS-ACTIVE) until there are sufficient resources.
