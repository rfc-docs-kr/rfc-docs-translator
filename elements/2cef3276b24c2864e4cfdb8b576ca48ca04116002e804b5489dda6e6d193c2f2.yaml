          Adjacencies are established with some subset of the router's
          neighbors.  Routers connected by point-to-point networks,
          Point-to-MultiPoint networks and virtual links always become
          adjacent.  On broadcast and NBMA networks, all routers become
          adjacent to both the Designated Router and the Backup Designated
          Router.
