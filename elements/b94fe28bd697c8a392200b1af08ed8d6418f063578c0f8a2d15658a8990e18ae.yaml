     The following <rpc> element invokes the NETCONF <get> method and
     includes an additional attribute called "user-id".  Note that the
     "user-id" attribute is not in the NETCONF namespace.  The returned
     <rpc-reply> element returns the "user-id" attribute, as well as the
     requested content.
