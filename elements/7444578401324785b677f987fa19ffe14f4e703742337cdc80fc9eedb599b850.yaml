     Finally, the optional parameter "notifyCompletion" allows a MGC to
     indicate that it wishes to be notified when the signal finishes
     playout.  The possible cases are that the signal timed out, that it
     was interrupted by an event, that it was halted when a Signals
     Descriptor was replaced, or that it stopped or never started for
     other reasons.  If the notifyCompletion parameter is not included in
     a Signals Descriptor, notification is generated only if the signal
     stopped or was never started for other reasons.  For reporting to
     occur, the signal completion event (see section E.1.2) must be
     enabled in the currently active Events Descriptor.
