              If the router is eligible to become Designated Router, it
              must periodically send Hello Packets to all neighbors that
              are also eligible.  In addition, if the router is itself the
              Designated Router or Backup Designated Router, it must also
              send periodic Hello Packets to all other neighbors.  This
              means that any two eligible routers are always exchanging
              Hello Packets, which is necessary for the correct operation
              of the Designated Router election algorithm.  To minimize
              the number of Hello Packets sent, the number of eligible
              routers on an NBMA network should be kept small.
