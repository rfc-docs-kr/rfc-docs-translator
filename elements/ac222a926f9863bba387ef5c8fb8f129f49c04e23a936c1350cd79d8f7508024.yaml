              If a router advertises a summary-LSA for a destination which
              then becomes unreachable, the router must then flush the LSA
              from the routing domain by setting its age to MaxAge and
              reflooding (see Section 14.1).  Also, if the destination is
              still reachable, yet can no longer be advertised according
              to the above procedure (e.g., it is now an inter-area route,
              when it used to be an intra-area route associated with some
              non-backbone area; it would thus no longer be advertisable
              to the backbone), the LSA should also be flushed from the
              routing domain.
