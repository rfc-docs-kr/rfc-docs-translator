     The onramp gateway SHOULD provide functionality for choosing the
     destination offramp gateway by analyzing a destination fax number.  A
     possible method to expand or acquire information from the onramp
     gateway about offramp gateways MAY include keeping cached information
     about sender addresses that was sent by other onramp gateways.
