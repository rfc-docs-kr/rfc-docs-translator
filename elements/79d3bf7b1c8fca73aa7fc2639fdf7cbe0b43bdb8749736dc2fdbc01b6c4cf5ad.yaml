     It is not recommended to use a generic big number library such as the
     one in OpenSSL for the arithmetic operations in Poly1305.  Such
     libraries use dynamic allocation to be able to handle an integer of
     any size, but that flexibility comes at the expense of performance as
     well as side-channel security.  More efficient implementations that
     run in constant time are available, one of them in D. J. Bernstein's
     own library, NaCl ([NaCl]).  A constant-time but not optimal approach
     would be to naively implement the arithmetic operations for 288-bit
     integers, because even a naive implementation will not exceed 2^288
     in the multiplication of (acc+block) and r.  An efficient constant-
     time implementation can be found in the public domain library
     poly1305-donna ([Poly1305_Donna]).
