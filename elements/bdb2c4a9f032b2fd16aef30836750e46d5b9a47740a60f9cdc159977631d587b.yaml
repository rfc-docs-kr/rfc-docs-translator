     A pinned certificate is subject to a man-in-the-middle attack at
     account setup time and typically lacks a mechanism to automatically
     revoke or securely refresh the certificate.  Note also that a man-in-
     the-middle attack at account setup time will expose the user's
     password to the attacker (if a password is used).  Therefore, the use
     of a pinned certificate does not meet the requirement for a minimum
     confidentiality level, and an MUA MUST NOT indicate to the user that
     such confidentiality is provided.  Additional advice on certificate
     pinning is presented in [RFC6125].
