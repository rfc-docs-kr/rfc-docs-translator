     The access device also MUST issue an STR for a session that was
     authorized but never actually started.  This could occur, for
     example, due to a sudden resource shortage in the access device, or
     because the access device is unwilling to provide the type of service
     requested in the authorization, or because the access device does not
     support a mandatory AVP returned in the authorization, etc.
