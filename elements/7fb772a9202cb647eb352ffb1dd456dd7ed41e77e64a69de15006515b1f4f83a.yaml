        When using double exchanges for ASPSM messages, the management of
        the connection in the two directions is considered independent.
        This means that connections from IPSP-A to IPSP-B is handled
        independently of connections from IPSP-B to IPSP-A.  Therefore, it
        could happen that only one of the two directions is activated or
        closed, while the other remains in the same state as it was.
