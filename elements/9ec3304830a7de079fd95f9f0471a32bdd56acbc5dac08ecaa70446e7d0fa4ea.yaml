     In the case where the offending AVP is embedded within a Grouped AVP,
     the Failed-AVP MAY contain the grouped AVP, which in turn contains
     the single offending AVP.  The same method MAY be employed if the
     grouped AVP itself is embedded in yet another grouped AVP and so on.
     In this case, the Failed-AVP MAY contain the grouped AVP hierarchy up
     to the single offending AVP.  This enables the recipient to detect
     the location of the offending AVP when embedded in a group.
