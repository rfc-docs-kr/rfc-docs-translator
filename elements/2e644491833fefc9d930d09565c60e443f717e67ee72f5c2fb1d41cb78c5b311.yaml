     The Poly1305 key MUST be unpredictable to an attacker.  Randomly
     generating the key would fulfill this requirement, except that
     Poly1305 is often used in communications protocols, so the receiver
     should know the key.  Pseudorandom number generation such as by
     encrypting a counter is acceptable.  Using ChaCha with a secret key
     and a nonce is also acceptable.
