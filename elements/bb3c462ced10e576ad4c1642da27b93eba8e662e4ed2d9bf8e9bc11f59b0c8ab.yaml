     When a client is configured to use RADIUS Accounting, at the start of
     service delivery it will generate an Accounting Start packet
     describing the type of service being delivered and the user it is
     being delivered to, and will send that to the RADIUS Accounting
     server, which will send back an acknowledgement that the packet has
     been received.  At the end of service delivery the client will
     generate an Accounting Stop packet describing the type of service
     that was delivered and optionally statistics such as elapsed time,
     input and output octets, or input and output packets.  It will send
     that to the RADIUS Accounting server, which will send back an
     acknowledgement that the packet has been received.
