     At the ASP, the ASP Down Ack message received is not acknowledged.
     Layer Management is informed with an M-ASP_DOWN confirm primitive.
     If the ASP receives an ASP Down Ack without having sent an ASP Down
     message, the ASP should now consider itself to be in the ASP-DOWN
     state.
