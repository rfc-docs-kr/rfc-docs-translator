          To deal with this situation, the OSPF protocol allows an AS
          boundary router to specify a "forwarding address" in its AS-
          external-LSAs.  In the above example, Router RT7 would specify
          RTX's IP address as the "forwarding address" for all those
          destinations whose packets should be routed directly to RTX.
