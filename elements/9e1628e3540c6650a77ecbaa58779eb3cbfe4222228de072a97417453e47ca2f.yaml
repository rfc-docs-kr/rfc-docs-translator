     Within EAP, the Type field functions much like a port number in UDP
     or TCP.  It is assumed that the EAP peer and authenticator layers
     demultiplex incoming EAP packets according to their Type, and deliver
     them only to the EAP method corresponding to that Type.  An EAP
     method implementation on a host may register to receive packets from
     the peer or authenticator layers, or both, depending on which role(s)
     it supports.
