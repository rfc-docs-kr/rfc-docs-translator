       DESCRIPTION
         "The interface index (value of ifIndex) that this action occurs
         on. This may be derived from the diffServDataPathStartEntry's
         index by extension through the various RowPointers. However, as
         this may be difficult for a network management station, it is
         placed here as well.  If this is indeterminate, the value is
         zero.
