        Rather than forwarding requests and responses between clients and
        servers, redirect agents refer clients to servers and allow them
        to communicate directly.  Since redirect agents do not sit in the
        forwarding path, they do not alter any AVPs transiting between
        client and server.  Redirect agents do not originate messages and
        are capable of handling any message type, although they may be
        configured only to redirect messages of certain types, while
        acting as relay or proxy agents for other types.  As with relay
        agents, redirect agents do not keep state with respect to sessions
        or NAS resources.
