     For the multi-homed clients, we will assume that C4 is advertised as
     primary via "RA" and secondary via "RB"; C5 is primary via "RB" and
     secondary via "RA". To connect this mess together, we will assume
     that "RA" and "RB" are connected via some common "backbone" provider
     "BB".
