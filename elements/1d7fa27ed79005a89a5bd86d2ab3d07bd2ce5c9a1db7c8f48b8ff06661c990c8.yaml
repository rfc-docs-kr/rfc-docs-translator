     CIDR was designed to be a short-term solution to the problems of
     routing state and address depletion on the IPv4 Internet.  It does
     not change the fundamental Internet routing or addressing
     architectures.  It is not expected to affect any plans for transition
     to a more long-term solution except, perhaps, by delaying the urgency
     of developing such a solution.
