          When receiving an Hello Packet from a neighbor on a broadcast,
          Point-to-MultiPoint or NBMA network, set the neighbor
          structure's Neighbor ID equal to the Router ID found in the
          packet's OSPF header.  For these network types, the neighbor
          structure's Router Priority field, Neighbor's Designated Router
          field, and Neighbor's Backup Designated Router field are also
          set equal to the corresponding fields found in the received
          Hello Packet; changes in these fields should be noted for
          possible use in the steps below.  When receiving an Hello on a
          point-to-point network (but not on a virtual link) set the
          neighbor structure's Neighbor IP address to the packet's IP
          source address.
