          (2) Calculate the new Backup Designated Router for the network
              as follows.  Only those routers on the list that have not
              declared themselves to be Designated Router are eligible to
              become Backup Designated Router.  If one or more of these
              routers have declared themselves Backup Designated Router
              (i.e., they are currently listing themselves as Backup
              Designated Router, but not as Designated Router, in their
              Hello Packets) the one having highest Router Priority is
              declared to be Backup Designated Router.  In case of a tie,
              the one having the highest Router ID is chosen.  If no
              routers have declared themselves Backup Designated Router,
