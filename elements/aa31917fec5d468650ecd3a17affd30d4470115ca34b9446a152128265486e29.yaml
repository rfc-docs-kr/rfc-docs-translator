     The use of wildcards ALL and CHOOSE is allowed in the protocol. This
     allows a MGC to partially specify Termination IDs and let the MG
     choose from the values that conform to the partial specification.
     Termination IDs may encode a hierarchy of names.  This hierarchy is
     provisioned. For instance, a TerminationID may consist of a trunk
     group, a trunk within the group and a circuit.  Wildcarding must be
     possible at all levels.  The following paragraphs explain how this is
     achieved.
