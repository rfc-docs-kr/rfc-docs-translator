     Figure 4 shows an example AS state machine for the case where the
     AS/ASP data is preconfigured and is an n+k redundancy model.  In
     other cases where the AS/ASP configuration data is created
     dynamically, there would be differences in the state machine,
     especially at creation of the AS.
