              When multiple intra-AS paths are available to
              ASBRs/forwarding addresses, the following rules indicate
              which paths are preferred. These rules apply when the same
              ASBR is reachable through multiple areas, or when trying to
              decide which of several AS-external-LSAs should be
              preferred. In the former case the paths all terminate at the
              same ASBR, while in the latter the paths terminate at
              separate ASBRs/forwarding addresses. In either case, each
              path is represented by a separate routing table entry as
              defined in Section 11.
