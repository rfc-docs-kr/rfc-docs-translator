     NETCONF uses a simple RPC-based mechanism to facilitate communication
     between a client and a server.  The client can be a script or
     application typically running as part of a network manager.  The
     server is typically a network device.  The terms "device" and
     "server" are used interchangeably in this document, as are "client"
     and "application".
