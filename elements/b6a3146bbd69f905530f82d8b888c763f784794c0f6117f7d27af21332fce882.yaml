        The host IP layer has two basic functions:  (1) choose the "next
        hop" gateway or host for outgoing IP datagrams and (2) reassemble
        incoming IP datagrams.  The IP layer may also (3) implement
        intentional fragmentation of outgoing datagrams.  Finally, the IP
        layer must (4) provide diagnostic and error functionality.  We
        expect that IP layer functions may increase somewhat in the
        future, as further Internet control and management facilities are
        developed.
