          Area border routers originate a single summary-LSA for each
          known inter-area destination.  AS boundary routers originate a
          single AS-external-LSA for each known AS external destination.
          Destinations are advertised one at a time so that the change in
          any single route can be flooded without reflooding the entire
          collection of routes.  During the flooding procedure, many LSAs
          can be carried by a single Link State Update packet.
