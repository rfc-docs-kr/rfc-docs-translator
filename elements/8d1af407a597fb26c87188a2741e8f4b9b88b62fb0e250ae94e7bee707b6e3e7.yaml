     The CHOOSE wildcard in a topology descriptor matches the
     TerminationID that the MG assigns in the first Add command that uses
     a CHOOSE wildcard in the same action.  An existing Termination that
     matches T1 or T2 in the Context to which a Termination is added, is
     connected to the newly added Termination as specified by the topology
     descriptor. The default association when a termination is not
     mentioned in the Topology descriptor is bothway (if T3 is added to a
     context with T1 and T2 with topology (T3,T1,oneway) it will be
     connected bothway to T2).
