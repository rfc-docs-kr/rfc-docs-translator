     NAT is compute intensive even with the help of a clever checksum
     adjustment algorithm, as each data packet is subject to NAT lookup
     and modifications.  As a result, router forwarding throughput could
     be slowed considerably. However, so long as the processing capacity
     of the NAT device exceeds line processing rate, this should not be a
     problem.
