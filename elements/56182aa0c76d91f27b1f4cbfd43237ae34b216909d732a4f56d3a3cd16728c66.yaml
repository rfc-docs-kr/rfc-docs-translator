     The Media Gateway Controller may return an ServiceChangeMgcId
     parameter that describes the Media Gateway Controller that should
     preferably be contacted for further service by the Media Gateway. In
     this case the Media Gateway shall reissue the ServiceChange command
     to the new Media Gateway Controller.   The Gateway specified in an
     ServiceChangeMgcId, if provided, shall be contacted before any
     further alternate MGCs.  On a HandOff message from MGC to MG, the
     ServiceChangeMgcId is the new MGC that will take over from the
     current MGC.
