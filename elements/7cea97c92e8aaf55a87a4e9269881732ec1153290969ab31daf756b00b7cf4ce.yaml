        Note that the use of the Identifier field in the MD5-Challenge
        Type is different from that described in [RFC1994].  EAP allows
        for retransmission of MD5-Challenge Request packets, while
        [RFC1994] states that both the Identifier and Challenge fields
        MUST change each time a Challenge (the CHAP equivalent of the
        MD5-Challenge Request packet) is sent.
