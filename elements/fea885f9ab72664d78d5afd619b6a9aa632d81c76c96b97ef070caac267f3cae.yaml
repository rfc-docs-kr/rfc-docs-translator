     MUAs MAY implement client certificate authentication on the Implicit
     TLS port.  An MUA MUST NOT provide a client certificate during the
     TLS handshake unless the server requests one and the MUA has been
     authorized to use that client certificate with that account.  Having
     the end user explicitly configure a client certificate for use with a
     given account is sufficient to meet this requirement.  However,
     installing a client certificate for use with one account MUST NOT
     automatically authorize the use of that certificate with other
     accounts.  This is not intended to prohibit site-specific
     authorization mechanisms, such as (a) a site-administrator-controlled
     mechanism to authorize the use of a client certificate with a given
     account or (b) a domain-name-matching mechanism.
