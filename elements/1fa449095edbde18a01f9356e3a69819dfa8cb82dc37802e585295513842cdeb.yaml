           A host computer, or simply "host," is the ultimate consumer of
           communication services.  A host generally executes application
           programs on behalf of user(s), employing network and/or
           Internet communication services in support of this function.
           An Internet host corresponds to the concept of an "End-System"
           used in the OSI protocol suite [INTRO:13].
