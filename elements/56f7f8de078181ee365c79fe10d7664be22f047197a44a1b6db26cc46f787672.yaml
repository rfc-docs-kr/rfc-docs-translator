     Many deployed BGP speakers send and accept any and all route
     announcements between their BGP neighbors by default.  This practice
     dates back to the early days of the Internet, where operators were
     permissive in sending routing information to allow all networks to
     reach each other.  As the Internet has become more densely
     interconnected, the risk of a misbehaving BGP speaker poses
     significant risks to Internet routing.
