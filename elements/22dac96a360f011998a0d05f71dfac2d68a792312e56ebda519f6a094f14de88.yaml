     Depending on the lower layer, EAP methods may run before or after
     ciphersuite negotiation, so that the selected ciphersuite may not be
     known to the EAP method.  By providing keying material usable with
     any ciphersuite, EAP methods can used with a wide range of
     ciphersuites and media.
