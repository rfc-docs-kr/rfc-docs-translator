     For example, within PPP, the ciphersuite is negotiated within the
     Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) defined in [RFC1968], after EAP
     authentication is completed.  Within [IEEE-802.11], the AP
     ciphersuites are advertised in the Beacon and Probe Responses prior
     to EAP authentication and are securely verified during a 4-way
     handshake exchange.

  예를 들어, PPP 내에서 암호화 제품군은 EAP 인증이 완료된 후 [RFC1968]에 정의된 ECP(암호화 제어 프로토콜) 내에서 협상됩니다. [IEEE-802.11] 내에서 AP 암호화 제품군은 EAP 인증 이전에 비컨 및 프로브 응답에 광고되고 4방향 핸드셰이크 교환 중에 안전하게 확인됩니다.
