     Previous standards for the use of email protocols with TLS used the
     STARTTLS mechanism: [RFC2595], [RFC3207], and [RFC3501].  With
     STARTTLS, the client establishes a cleartext application session and
     determines whether to issue a STARTTLS command based on server
     capabilities and client configuration.  If the client issues a
     STARTTLS command, a TLS handshake follows that can upgrade the
     connection.  Although this mechanism has been deployed, an alternate
     mechanism where TLS is negotiated immediately at connection start on
     a separate port (referred to in this document as "Implicit TLS") has
     been deployed more successfully.  To encourage more widespread use of
     TLS and to also encourage greater consistency regarding how TLS is
     used, this specification now recommends the use of Implicit TLS for
     POP, IMAP, SMTP Submission, and all other protocols used between an
     MUA and an MSP.
