        RADIUS implementations typically require that the name or address
        of servers or clients be manually configured, along with the
        corresponding shared secrets.  This results in a large
        administrative burden and creates the temptation to reuse the
        RADIUS shared secret, which can result in major security
        vulnerabilities if the Request Authenticator is not globally and
        temporally unique as required in [RFC2865].  Through DNS, Diameter
        enables dynamic discovery of peers (see Section 5.2).  Derivation
        of dynamic session keys is enabled via transmission-level
        security.
