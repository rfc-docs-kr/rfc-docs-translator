     Still, RSAES-OAEP is secure against CCA2, which was proved by
     Fujisaki, Okamoto, Pointcheval, and Stern [FOPS] shortly after the
     announcement of Shoup's result.  Using clever lattice reduction
     techniques, they managed to show how to invert RSAEP completely given
     a sufficiently large part of the pre-image.  This observation,
     combined with a proof that OAEP is secure against CCA2 if the
     underlying encryption primitive is hard to partially invert, fills
     the gap between what Bellare and Rogaway proved about RSAES-OAEP and
     what some may have believed that they proved.  Somewhat
     paradoxically, we are hence saved by an ostensible weakness in RSAEP
     (i.e., the whole inverse can be deduced from parts of it).

  그럼에도 불구하고 RSAES-OAEP는 Shoup의 결과 발표 직후 Fujisaki, Okamoto, Pointcheval 및 Stern [FOPS]에 의해 입증된 CCA2에 대해 안전합니다. 영리한 격자 감소 기술을 사용하여 사전 이미지의 충분히 큰 부분이 주어지면 RSAEP를 완전히 반전시키는 방법을 보여주었습니다. 이 관찰은 기본 암호화 기본 요소를 부분적으로 반전시키기 어려운 경우 OAEP가 CCA2에 대해 안전하다는 증거와 결합되어 Bellare와 Rogaway가 RSAES-OAEP에 대해 증명한 것과 일부 사람들이 증명했다고 믿었던 것 사이의 격차를 메워줍니다. 다소 역설적이게도 RSAEP의 표면적인 약점으로 인해 우리는 구원을 받습니다(즉, 전체 역은 RSAEP의 일부에서 추론될 수 있습니다).
