              Every host MUST implement an ICMP Echo server function that
              receives Echo Requests and sends corresponding Echo Replies.
              A host SHOULD also implement an application-layer interface
              for sending an Echo Request and receiving an Echo Reply, for
              diagnostic purposes.
