        -  Support for extended_master_secret is now a "MUST" (previously
           it was a soft recommendation, as the RFC had not been published
           at the time).  Also removed other, more complicated, related
           mitigations.

  - Extended_master_secret에 대한 지원은 이제 "필수"입니다(이전에는 RFC가 당시 게시되지 않았기 때문에 이는 소프트 권장 사항이었습니다). 또한 더 복잡하고 관련된 다른 완화 조치도 제거되었습니다.
