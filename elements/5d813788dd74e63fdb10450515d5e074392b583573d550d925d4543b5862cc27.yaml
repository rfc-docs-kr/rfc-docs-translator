     different values may be appropriate.  For example, if the overhead of
     a UDP tunnel is not an issue, those candidates should be prioritized
     higher since they are likely to have a high success probability.
     Also, simultaneous-open is prioritized higher than active and passive
     candidates for NAT-assisted and server reflexive candidates since if
     TCP S-O is supported by the operating systems of both endpoints, it
     should work at least as well as the active-passive approach.  If an
     implementation is uncertain whether S-O candidates are supported, it
     may be reasonable to prioritize them lower.  For host, UDP-tunneled,
     and relayed candidates, the S-O candidates are prioritized lower than
     active and passive since active-passive candidates should work with
     them at least as well as the S-O candidates.
