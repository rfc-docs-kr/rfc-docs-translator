      A router periodically advertises its state, which is also called
      link state.  Link state is also advertised when a router's state
      changes.  A router's adjacencies are reflected in the contents of
      its LSAs.  This relationship between adjacencies and link state
      allows the protocol to detect dead routers in a timely fashion.
