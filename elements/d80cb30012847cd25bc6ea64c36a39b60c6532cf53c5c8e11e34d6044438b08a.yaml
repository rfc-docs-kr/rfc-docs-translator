     A Dynamic Authorization Server MUST silently discard Disconnect-
     Request or CoA-Request packets from untrusted sources.  In situations
     where the Dynamic Authorization Client is co-resident with a RADIUS
     authentication or accounting server, a proxy MAY perform a "reverse
     path forwarding" (RPF) check to verify that a Disconnect-Request or
     CoA-Request originates from an authorized Dynamic Authorization
     Client.  In addition, it SHOULD be possible to explicitly authorize
     additional sources of Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request packets
     relating to certain classes of sessions.  For example, a particular
     source can be explicitly authorized to send CoA-Request packets
     relating to users within a set of realms.
