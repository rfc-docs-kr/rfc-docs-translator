     As an example, say Host-A in figure 2 above, obtains a tuple of
     (Addr-Nx, TCP port T-Nx) from NAPT router to act as RSAP-IP-Client to
     initiate end-to-end TCP sessions with Host-X.  Traversal of end-to-
     end packets within private realm may be illustrated as follows. In
     the first method, outer layer of the outgoing packet from Host-A uses
     (private address Addr-A, source port T-Na) as source tuple to
     communicate with Host-X. NAPT router enroute translates this tuple
     into (Addr-Nx, Port T-Nxa). This translation is independent of RSAP-
     IP-Client tuple parameters used in the embedded packet.
