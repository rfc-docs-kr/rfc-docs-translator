     Connections between Diameter peers SHOULD be protected by TLS/TCP and
     DTLS/SCTP.  All Diameter base protocol implementations MUST support
     the use of TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP.  If desired, alternative security
     mechanisms that are independent of Diameter, such as IPsec [RFC4301],
     can be deployed to secure connections between peers.  The Diameter
     protocol MUST NOT be used without one of TLS, DTLS, or IPsec.
