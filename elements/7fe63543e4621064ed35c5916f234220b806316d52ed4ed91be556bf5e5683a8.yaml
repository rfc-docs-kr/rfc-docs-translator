     Classifiers can be simple or complex.  In a core interface, one would
     expect to find simple behavior aggregate classification to be used.
     However, in an edge interface, one might first ask what application
     is being used, meter the arriving traffic, and then apply various
     policies to the non-conforming traffic depending on the Autonomous
     System number advertising the destination address.  To accomplish
     such a thing, traffic must be classified, metered, and then
     reclassified.  To this end, the MIB defines separate classifiers,
     which may be applied at any point in processing, and may have
     different content as needed.
