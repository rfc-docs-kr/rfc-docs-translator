     Media Gateway (MG): The media gateway converts media provided in one
     type of network to the format required in another type of network.
     For example, a MG could terminate bearer channels from a switched
     circuit network (e.g., DS0s) and media streams from a packet network
     (e.g., RTP streams in an IP network).  This gateway may be capable of
     processing audio, video and T.120 alone or in any combination, and
     will be capable of full duplex media translations.  The MG may also
     play audio/video messages and perform other IVR functions, or may
     perform media conferencing.
