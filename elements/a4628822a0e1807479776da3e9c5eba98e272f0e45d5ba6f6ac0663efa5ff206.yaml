     To implement an EF and two AF classes, one must use a combination of
     priority and WRR/WFQ scheduling.  This requires us to cascade two
     schedulers.  If one were to additionally shape the output of the
     system to a rate lower than the interface rate, one must place an
     upper bound rate on the output of the priority scheduler.  See figure
     6.
