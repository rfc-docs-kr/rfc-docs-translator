     [3] Peer policy satisfaction.  EAP methods may support result
         indications, enabling the peer to indicate to the EAP server
         within the method that it successfully authenticated the EAP
         server, as well as for the server to indicate that it has
         authenticated the peer.  However, a pass-through authenticator
         will not be aware that the peer has accepted the credentials
         offered by the EAP server, unless this information is provided to
         the authenticator via the AAA protocol.  The authenticator SHOULD
         interpret the receipt of a key attribute within an Accept packet
         as an indication that the peer has successfully authenticated the
         server.
