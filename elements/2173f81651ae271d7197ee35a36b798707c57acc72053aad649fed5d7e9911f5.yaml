     To utilize paths that include memory-constrained routers, RPL relies
     on source routing.  In one deployment model of RPL, more-capable
     routers collect routing information and form paths to arbitrary
     destinations within a RPL routing domain.  However, a source routing
     mechanism supported by IPv6 is needed to deliver datagrams.
