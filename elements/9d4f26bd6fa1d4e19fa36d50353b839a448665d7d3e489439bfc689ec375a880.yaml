     The possible reasons for this AVP are the presence of an improperly
     constructed AVP, an unsupported or unrecognized AVP, an invalid AVP
     value, the omission of a required AVP, the presence of an explicitly
     excluded AVP (see tables in Section 10) or the presence of two or
     more occurrences of an AVP that is restricted to 0, 1, or 0-1
     occurrences.
