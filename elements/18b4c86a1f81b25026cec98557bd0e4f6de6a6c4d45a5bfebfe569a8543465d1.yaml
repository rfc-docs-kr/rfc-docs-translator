        Note: [RFC2289] does not specify how the secret pass-phrase is
        entered by the user, or how the pass-phrase is converted into
        octets.  EAP OTP implementations MAY support entering passphrases
        with non-ASCII characters.  See Section 5 for instructions on how
        the input should be processed and encoded into octets.
