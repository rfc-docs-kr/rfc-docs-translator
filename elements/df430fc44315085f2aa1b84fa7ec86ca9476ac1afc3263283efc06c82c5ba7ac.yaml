          Externally derived routing data (e.g., routes learned from an
          Exterior Gateway Protocol such as BGP; see [Ref23]) is
          advertised throughout the Autonomous System.  This externally
          derived data is kept separate from the OSPF protocol's link
          state data.  Each external route can also be tagged by the
          advertising router, enabling the passing of additional
          information between routers on the boundary of the Autonomous
          System.
