          The stub networks are added to the tree in the procedure's
          second stage.  In this stage, all router vertices are again
          examined.  Those that have been determined to be unreachable in
          the above first phase are discarded.  For each reachable router
          vertex (call it V), the associated router-LSA is found in the
          link state database.  Each stub network link appearing in the
          LSA is then examined, and the following steps are executed:
