      [8]Note that it is possible for a router to resynchronize any of its
      fully established adjacencies by setting the adjacency's state back
      to ExStart.  This will cause the other end of the adjacency to
      process a SeqNumberMismatch event, and therefore to also go back to
      ExStart state.
