     When the Event-Timestamp Attribute is present, both the Dynamic
     Authorization Server and the Dynamic Authorization Client MUST check
     that the Event-Timestamp Attribute is current within an acceptable
     time window.  If the Event-Timestamp Attribute is not current, then
     the packet MUST be silently discarded.  This implies the need for
     loose time synchronization within the network, which can be achieved
     by a variety of means, including Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP),
     as described in [RFC4330].  Implementations SHOULD be configurable to
     discard CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request packets not containing an
     Event-Timestamp Attribute.
