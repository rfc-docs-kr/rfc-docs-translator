      [13]When two LSAs have different LS checksums, they are assumed to
      be separate instances.  This can occur when a router restarts, and
      loses track of the LSA's previous LS sequence number.  In the case
      where the two LSAs have the same LS sequence number, it is not
      possible to determine which LSA is actually newer.  However, if the
      wrong LSA is accepted as newer, the originating router will simply
      originate another instance.  See Section 13.4 for further details.
