          *  A transport spec using SRTP and MIKEY is selected and a MIKEY
             response message can be created.  The server SHOULD use the
             same certificate for TLS and in MIKEY to enable the client to
             bind the two together.  If a different certificate is used,
             it SHALL be included in the MIKEY message.  It is RECOMMENDED
             that the envelope key-cache type be set to 'Cache' and that a
             single envelope key is reused for all MIKEY messages to the
             client.  That message is included in the MIKEY parameter part
             of the single selected transport specification in the SETUP
             response.  The server will set the SRTP parameters as
             preferred for this media stream within the supported range by
             the client.
