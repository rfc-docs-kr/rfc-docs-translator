     free router is greatly reduced since most new address assignment will
     come from one of the large blocks allocated to the service providers.
     For the sake of this analysis, we assume prompt implementation of
     this proposal and deployment of the revised routing protocols. We
     make the initial assumption that any initial block given to a
     provider is sufficient to satisfy its needs for two years.
