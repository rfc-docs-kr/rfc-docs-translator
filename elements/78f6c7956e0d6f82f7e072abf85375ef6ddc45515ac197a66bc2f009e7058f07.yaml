     Routing within a class A used for CIDR is also an interesting
     challenge.  The usual case will be that a domain will be assigned a
     portion of the class A address space.  The domain can either use an
     IGP which allows variable length subnets or it can pick a single
     subnet mask to be used throughout the domain.  In the latter case,
     difficulties arise because other domains have been allocated other
     parts of the class A address space and may be using a different
     subnet mask.  If the domain is itself a transit, it may also need to
     allocate some portion of its space to a client, which might also use
     a different subnet mask.  The client would then need routing
     information about the remainder of the class A.
