     The key here is that, prior to the listen() call, the full set of
     sockets that need to be utilized for outgoing connections must be
     allocated and bound to the local IP address and port.  This number,
     MAX, represents the maximum number of TCP connections to different
     destinations that might need to be established from the same local
     candidate.  This number can be potentially large for simultaneous-
     open candidates.  If a request forks, ICE procedures may take place
     with multiple peers.  Furthermore, for each peer, connections would
     need to be established to each passive or simultaneous-open candidate
     for the same component.  If we assume a worst case of 5 forked
     branches, and for each peer, five simultaneous-open candidates, that
     results in MAX=25.
