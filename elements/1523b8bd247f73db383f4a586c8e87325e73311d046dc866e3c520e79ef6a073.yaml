          Attaching an address mask to each route also enables the support
          of IP supernetting. For example, a single physical network
          segment could be assigned the [address,mask] pair
          [192.9.4.0,0xfffffc00]. The segment would then be single IP
          network, containing addresses from the four consecutive class C
          network numbers 192.9.4.0 through 192.9.7.0. Such addressing is
          now becoming commonplace with the advent of CIDR (see [Ref10]).
