     ipForwardMask OBJECT-TYPE
         SYNTAX     IpAddress
         MAX-ACCESS read-create
         STATUS     obsolete
         DESCRIPTION
                "Indicate the mask to be logical-ANDed with the
                 destination address before being compared to the value
                 in the ipForwardDest field.  For those systems that do
                 not support arbitrary subnet masks, an agent constructs
                 the value of the ipForwardMask by reference to the IP
                 Address Class.
