     If a TWAMP Server receives an unexpected Command Number, it MUST
     respond with the Accept field set to 3 (meaning "Some aspect of
     request is not supported") in the Accept-Session message.  Command
     Numbers that are Forbidden (and possibly numbers that are Reserved)
     are unexpected.
