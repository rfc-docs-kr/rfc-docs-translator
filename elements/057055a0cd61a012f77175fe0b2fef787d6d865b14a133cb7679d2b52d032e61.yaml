          BackupSeen
              The router has detected the existence or non-existence of a
              Backup Designated Router for the network.  This is done in
              one of two ways.  First, an Hello Packet may be received
              from a neighbor claiming to be itself the Backup Designated
              Router.  Alternatively, an Hello Packet may be received from
              a neighbor claiming to be itself the Designated Router, and
              indicating that there is no Backup Designated Router.  In
              either case there must be bidirectional communication with
              the neighbor, i.e., the router must also appear in the
              neighbor's Hello Packet.  This event signals an end to the
              Waiting state.
