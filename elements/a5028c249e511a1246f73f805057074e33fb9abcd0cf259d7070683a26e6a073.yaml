     For succession, it answers the question "what happens next?".  Rather
     than presume that the next table must be as specified in the
     conceptual model [MODEL] and providing its index, the RowPointer
     takes you to the MIB row representing that thing.  In the
     diffServMeterTable, for example, the diffServMeterFailNext RowPointer
     might take you to another meter, while the diffServMeterSucceedNext
     RowPointer would take you to an action.
