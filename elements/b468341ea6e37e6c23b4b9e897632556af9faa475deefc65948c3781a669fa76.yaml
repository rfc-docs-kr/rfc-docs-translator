     [RFC3692] recommends allocating an appropriate number of values for
     experimentation and testing.  It is not clear to the authors exactly
     how many numbers might be useful in this space, or if it would be
     useful that they were easily distinguishable or at the "high end" of
     the number range.  Two might be useful, say one for session control,
     and one for session fetch.  On the other hand, a single number would
     allow for unlimited extension, because the format of the rest of the
     message could be tailored, with allocation of other numbers done once
     usefulness has been proven.  Thus, this document allocates one number
     (6) as designated for experimentation and testing.
