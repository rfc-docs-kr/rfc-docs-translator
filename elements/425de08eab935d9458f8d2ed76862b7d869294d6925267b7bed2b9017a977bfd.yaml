     When encoding these candidates into offers and answers, the type of
     the candidate is signaled.  In the case of active candidates, both IP
     address and port are present, but the port is meaningless (it is
     there only for making encoding of active candidates consistent with
     the other candidate types and is ignored by the peer).  As a
     consequence, active candidates do not need to be physically allocated
