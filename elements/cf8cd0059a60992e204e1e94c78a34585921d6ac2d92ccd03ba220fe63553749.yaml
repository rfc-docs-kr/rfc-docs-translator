          A detailed description of the interface state changes follows.
          Each state change is invoked by an event (Section 9.2).  This
          event may produce different effects, depending on the current
          state of the interface.  For this reason, the state machine
          below is organized by current interface state and received
          event.  Each entry in the state machine describes the resulting
          new interface state and the required set of additional actions.
