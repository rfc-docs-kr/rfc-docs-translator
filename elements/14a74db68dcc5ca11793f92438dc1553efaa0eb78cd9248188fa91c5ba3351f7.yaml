     1) Graceful - indicates that the specified Terminations will be taken
        out of service after the specified ServiceChangeDelay; established
        connections are not yet affected, but the Media Gateway Controller
        should refrain from establishing new connections and should
        attempt to gracefully tear down existing connections on the
        Termination(s) affected by the serviceChange command. The MG
        should set termination serviceState at the expiry of
        ServiceChangeDelay or the removal of the termination from an
        active context (whichever is first), to "out of service".
