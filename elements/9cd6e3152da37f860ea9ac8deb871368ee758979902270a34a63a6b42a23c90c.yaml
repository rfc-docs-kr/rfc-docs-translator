     While X.509 forbids end-entity certificates from being used as
     issuers for other certificates, it is valid to use them to issue
     other signed objects as long as the certificate contains the
     digitalSignature KeyUsage ([RFC5280], Section 4.2.1.3).  (All
     certificates compatible with TLS 1.3 are required to contain the
     digitalSignature KeyUsage.)  This document defines a new signed
     object format that encodes only the semantics that are needed for
     this application.  The Credential has the following structure:
