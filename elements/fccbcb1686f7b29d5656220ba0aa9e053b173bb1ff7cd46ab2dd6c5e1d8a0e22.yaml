      A router then uses the OSPF's Hello Protocol to acquire neighbors.
      The router sends Hello packets to its neighbors, and in turn
      receives their Hello packets.  On broadcast and point-to-point
      networks, the router dynamically detects its neighboring routers by
      sending its Hello packets to the multicast address AllSPFRouters.
      On non-broadcast networks, some configuration information may be
      necessary in order to discover neighbors.  On broadcast and NBMA
      networks the Hello Protocol also elects a Designated router for the
      network.
