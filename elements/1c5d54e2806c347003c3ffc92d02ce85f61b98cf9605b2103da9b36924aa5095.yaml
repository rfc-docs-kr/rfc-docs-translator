        When an ARP request or reply is received, all implementations are
        required to understand frames with no RIF (local ring) and frames
        with an empty RIF (also from the local ring).  If the
        implementation supports multi-ring source routing, then a non-
        empty RIF is stored for future transmissions to the host
        originating the ARP request or reply.  If source routing is not
        supported them all packets with non-empty RIFs should be
        gracefully ignored.  This policy will allow all implementations in
        a single ring environment, to interoperate, whether or not they
        support the multi-ring extensions.
