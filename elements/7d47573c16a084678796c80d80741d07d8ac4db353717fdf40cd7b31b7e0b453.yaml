          (5) If this cost is less than the cost occurring in N's routing
              table entry, overwrite N's list of next hops with those used
              for BR, and set N's routing table cost to IAC. Else, if IAC
              is the same as N's current cost, add BR's list of next hops
              to N's list of next hops. In any case, the area associated
              with N's routing table entry must remain the backbone area,
              and the path type (either intra-area or inter-area) must
              also remain the same.
