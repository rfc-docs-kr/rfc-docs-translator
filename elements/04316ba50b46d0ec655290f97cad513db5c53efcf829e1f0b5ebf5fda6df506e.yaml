          Again using Routers RT3 and RT4 as an example, the procedure
          goes as follows: They first calculate the SPF tree for the
          backbone.  This gives the distances to all other area border
          routers.  Also noted are the distances to networks (Ia and Ib)
          and AS boundary routers (RT5 and RT7) that belong to the
          backbone.  This calculation is shown in Table 5.
