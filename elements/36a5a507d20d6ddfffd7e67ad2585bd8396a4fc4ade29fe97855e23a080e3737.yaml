     BGP routing security issues need to be addressed in order to make the
     Internet more stable.  Route leaks [RFC7908] are part of the problem,
     but software defects or operator misconfiguration can also
     contribute.  This document updates [RFC4271] so that routes are
     neither imported nor exported unless specifically enabled by
     configuration.  This change reduces the consequences of these
     problems and improves the default level of Internet routing security.
