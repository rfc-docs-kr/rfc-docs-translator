     When originally proposed in [RFC1338] and [RFC1519], this addressing
     plan was intended to be a relatively short-term response, lasting
     approximately three to five years, during which a more permanent
     addressing and routing architecture would be designed and
     implemented.  As can be inferred from the dates on the original
     documents, CIDR has far outlasted its anticipated lifespan and has
     become the mid-term solution to the problems described above.
