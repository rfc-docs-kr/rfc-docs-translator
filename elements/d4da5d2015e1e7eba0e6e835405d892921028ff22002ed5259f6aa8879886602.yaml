        We assume that any inter-domain routing protocol will have
        difficulty trying to aggregate multiple destinations with
        dissimilar policies.  At the same time, the ability to aggregate
        routing information while not violating routing policies is
        essential. Therefore, we suggest that address allocation
        authorities attempt to allocate addresses so that aggregates of
        destinations with similar policies can be easily formed.
