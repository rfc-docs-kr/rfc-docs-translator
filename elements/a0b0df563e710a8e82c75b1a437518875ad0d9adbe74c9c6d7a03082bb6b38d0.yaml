        When the HMAC-MD5 message integrity check is calculated, the
        Message-Authenticator Attribute MUST be considered to be sixteen
        octets of zero.  The Request Authenticator is taken from the
        corresponding CoA/Disconnect-Request.  The Message-Authenticator
        is calculated and inserted in the packet before the Response
        Authenticator is calculated.
