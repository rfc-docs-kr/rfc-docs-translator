              DISCUSSION:
                   When a gateway does fail, the other gateways on the
                   connected network will learn of the failure through
                   some inter-gateway routing protocol.  However, this
                   will not happen instantaneously, since gateway routing
                   protocols typically have a settling time of 30-60
                   seconds.  If the host switches to an alternative
                   gateway before the gateways have agreed on the failure,
                   the new target gateway will probably forward the
                   datagram to the failed gateway and send a Redirect back
                   to the host pointing to the failed gateway (!).  The
                   result is likely to be a rapid oscillation in the
                   contents of the host's route cache during the gateway
                   settling period.  It has been proposed that the dead-
                   gateway logic should include some hysteresis mechanism
                   to prevent such oscillations.  However, experience has
                   not shown any harm from such oscillations, since
                   service cannot be restored to the host until the
                   gateways' routing information does settle down.
