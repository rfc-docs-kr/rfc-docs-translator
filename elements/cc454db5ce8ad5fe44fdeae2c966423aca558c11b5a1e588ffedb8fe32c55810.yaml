           At many points in this document, you will find a requirement
           that a parameter be a configurable option.  There are several
           different reasons behind such requirements.  In a few cases,
           there is current uncertainty or disagreement about the best
           value, and it may be necessary to update the recommended value
           in the future.  In other cases, the value really depends on
           external factors -- e.g., the size of the host and the
           distribution of its communication load, or the speeds and
           topology of nearby networks -- and self-tuning algorithms are
           unavailable and may be insufficient.  In some cases,
           configurability is needed because of administrative
           requirements.
