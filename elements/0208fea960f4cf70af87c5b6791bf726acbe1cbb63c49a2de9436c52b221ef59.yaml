     The DHCP server uses information from its lease binding database to
     supply the DHCPLEASEACTIVE option values.  The values of the options
     that were returned to the DHCP client would generally be preferred,
     but in the absence of those, options that were sent in DHCP client
     requests would be acceptable.

  DHCP 서버는 임대 바인딩 데이터베이스의 정보를 사용하여 DHCPLEASEACTIVE 옵션 값을 제공합니다. 일반적으로 DHCP 클라이언트에 반환된 옵션 값이 선호되지만 해당 값이 없는 경우 DHCP 클라이언트 요청으로 전송된 옵션이 허용됩니다.
