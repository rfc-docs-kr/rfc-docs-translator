     The function of the SRH is intended to be very similar to the Type 0
     Routing header defined in [RFC2460].  After the routing header has
     been processed and the IPv6 datagram resubmitted to the IPv6 module
     for processing, the IPv6 Destination Address contains the next hop's
     address.  When forwarding an IPv6 datagram that contains an SRH with
     a non-zero Segments Left value, if the IPv6 Destination Address is
     not on-link, a router MUST drop the datagram and SHOULD send an ICMP
     Destination Unreachable (ICMPv6 Type 1) message with ICMPv6 Code set
     to 7 to the packet's Source Address.  This ICMPv6 Code indicates that
     the IPv6 Destination Address is not on-link and the router cannot
     satisfy the strict source route requirement.  When generating ICMPv6
     error messages, the rules in Section 2.4 of [RFC4443] MUST be
     observed.
