          Use of this authentication type means that routing exchanges
          over the network/subnet are not authenticated.  The 64-bit
          authentication field in the OSPF header can contain anything; it
          is not examined on packet reception. When employing Null
          authentication, the entire contents of each OSPF packet (other
          than the 64-bit authentication field) are checksummed in order
          to detect data corruption.
