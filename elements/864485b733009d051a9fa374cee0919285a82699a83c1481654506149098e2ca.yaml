     Application Server Process (ASP) - A process instance of an
     Application Server.  An Application Server Process serves as an
     active or backup process of an Application Server (e.g., part of a
     distributed virtual switch or database).  Examples of ASPs are
     processes (or process instances) of MGCs, IP SCPs, or IP HLRs.  An
     ASP contains an SCTP endpoint and may be configured to process
     signalling traffic within more than one Application Server.
