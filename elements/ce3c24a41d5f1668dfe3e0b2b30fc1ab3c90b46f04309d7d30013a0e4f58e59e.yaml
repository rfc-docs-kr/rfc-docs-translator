     The protocol for certificate type negotiation is identical in
     operation to cipher suite negotiation as described in the TLS
     specification [RFC5246], with the addition of default values when the
     extension is omitted.  Since those omissions have a unique meaning
     and the same protection is applied to the values as with cipher
     suites, it is believed that the security properties of this
     negotiation are the same as with cipher suite negotiation.

  인증서 유형 협상을 위한 프로토콜은 TLS 사양 [RFC5246]에 설명된 대로 암호 그룹 협상과 작동이 동일하며 확장이 생략되면 기본값이 추가됩니다. 이러한 생략은 고유한 의미를 가지며 암호 그룹과 마찬가지로 값에 동일한 보호가 적용되므로 이 협상의 보안 속성은 암호 그룹 협상과 동일하다고 믿어집니다.
