     a) The temporal dynamics of popularity, i.e., how requests are
        distributed in time.  The popularity distribution expresses the
        number of requests submitted for each information item
        participating into a certain workload.  However, they do not
        describe how these requests are distributed in time.  This aspect
        is of primary importance when considering the performance of
        caching schemes since the ordering of the requests obviously
        affects the contents of a cache.  For example, with a Least
        Frequently Used (LFU) cache replacement policy, if all requests
        for a certain item are submitted close in time, the item is
        unlikely to be evicted from the cache, even by a (globally) more
        popular item whose requests are more evenly distributed in time.
        The temporal ordering of requests gains even more importance when
        considering workloads consisting of various applications, all
        competing for the same cache space.
