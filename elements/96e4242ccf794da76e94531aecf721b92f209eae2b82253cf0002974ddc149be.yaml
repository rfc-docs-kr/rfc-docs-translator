          The specification does not require that the above two stage
          method be used to calculate the shortest path tree.  However, if
          another algorithm is used, an identical tree must be produced.
          For this reason, it is important to note that links between
          transit vertices must be bidirectional in order to be included
          in the above tree.  It should also be mentioned that more
          efficient algorithms exist for calculating the tree; for
          example, the incremental SPF algorithm described in [Ref1].
