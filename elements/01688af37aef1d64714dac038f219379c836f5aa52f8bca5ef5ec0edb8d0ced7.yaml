                 b.  For each P-OID in the user-initial-policy-set that is
                     not the valid_policy of a node in the
                     valid_policy_node_set, create a child node whose
                     parent is the node of depth n-1 with the valid_policy
                     anyPolicy.  Set the values in the child node as
                     follows: set the valid_policy to P-OID, set the
                     qualifier_set to P-Q, and set the expected_policy_set
                     to {P-OID}.
