        The Authenticator field in an Accounting-Response packet is called
        the Response Authenticator, and contains a one-way MD5 hash
        calculated over a stream of octets consisting of the Accounting-
        Response Code, Identifier, Length, the Request Authenticator field
        from the Accounting-Request packet being replied to, and the
        response attributes if any, followed by the shared secret.  The
        resulting 16 octet MD5 hash value is stored in the Authenticator
        field of the Accounting-Response packet.
