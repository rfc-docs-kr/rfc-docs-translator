     Because the authentication process will often involve user input,
     some care must be taken when deciding upon retransmission strategies
     and authentication timeouts.  By default, where EAP is run over an
     unreliable lower layer, the EAP retransmission timer SHOULD be
     dynamically estimated.  A maximum of 3-5 retransmissions is
     suggested.
