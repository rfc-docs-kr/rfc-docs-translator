     NETCONF carries configuration data inside the <config> element that
     is specific to the device's data model.  The protocol treats the
     contents of that element as opaque data.  The device uses
     capabilities to announce the set of data models that the device
     implements.  The capability definition details the operation and
     constraints imposed by data model.
