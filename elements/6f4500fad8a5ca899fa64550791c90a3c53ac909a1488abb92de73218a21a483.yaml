     For the Application Servers for which the ASP can be successfully
     activated, the SGP or IPSP responds with one or more ASP Active Ack
     messages, including the associated Routing Context(s) and reflecting
     any Traffic Mode Type value present in the related ASP Active
     message.  The Routing Context parameter MUST be included in the ASP
     Active Ack message(s) if the received ASP Active message contained
     any Routing Contexts.  Depending on any Traffic Mode Type request in
     the ASP Active message, or local configuration data if there is no
     request, the SGP moves the ASP to the correct ASP traffic state
     within the associated Application Server(s).  Layer Management is
     informed with an M-ASP_Active indication.  If the SGP or IPSP
     receives any Data messages before an ASP Active message is received,
     the SGP or IPSP MAY discard them.  By sending an ASP Active Ack
     message, the SGP or IPSP is now ready to receive and send traffic for
     the related Routing Context(s).  The ASP SHOULD NOT send Data or SSNM
     messages for the related Routing Context(s) before receiving an ASP
     Active Ack message, or it will risk message loss.
