      The single backbone area (Area ID = 0.0.0.0) cannot be disconnected,
      or some areas of the Autonomous System will become unreachable.  To
      establish/maintain connectivity of the backbone, virtual links can
      be configured through non-backbone areas.  Virtual links serve to
      connect physically separate components of the backbone.  The two
      endpoints of a virtual link are area border routers.  The virtual
      link must be configured in both routers.  The configuration
      information in each router consists of the other virtual endpoint
      (the other area border router), and the non-backbone area the two
      routers have in common (called the Transit area).  Virtual links
      cannot be configured through stub areas (see Section 3.6).
