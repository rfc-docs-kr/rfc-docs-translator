     Hierarchical sub-allocation of addresses in this manner implies that
     clients with addresses allocated out of a given service provider are,
     for routing purposes, part of that service provider and will be
     routed via its infrastructure. This implies that routing information
     about multi-homed organizations, i.e., organizations connected to
     more than one network service provider, will still need to be known
     by higher levels in the hierarchy.
