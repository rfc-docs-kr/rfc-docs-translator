          Figure 6 shows a sample area configuration.  The first area
          consists of networks N1-N4, along with their attached routers
          RT1-RT4.  The second area consists of networks N6-N8, along with
          their attached routers RT7, RT8, RT10 and RT11.  The third area
          consists of networks N9-N11 and Host H1, along with their
          attached routers RT9, RT11 and RT12.  The third area has been
          configured so that networks N9-N11 and Host H1 will all be
          grouped into a single route, when advertised external to the
          area (see Section 3.5 for more details).
