          (a) If the LSA is listed in the Link state retransmission list
              for the receiving adjacency, the router itself is expecting
              an acknowledgment for this LSA.  The router should treat the
              received LSA as an acknowledgment by removing the LSA from
              the Link state retransmission list.  This is termed an
              "implied acknowledgment".  Its occurrence should be noted
              for later use by the acknowledgment process (Section 13.5).
