     The interaction of the certificate_types and
     supported_signature_algorithms fields is somewhat complicated.
     certificate_types has been present in TLS since SSLv3, but was
     somewhat underspecified.  Much of its functionality is superseded by
     supported_signature_algorithms.  The following rules apply:

  Certificate_types 및 Supported_signature_algorithms 필드의 상호 작용은 다소 복잡합니다. Certificate_types는 SSLv3부터 TLS에 존재했지만 다소 과소 지정되었습니다. 해당 기능의 대부분은 Supported_signature_algorithms로 대체됩니다. 다음 규칙이 적용됩니다.
