     - ASPSM messages.  When ASPSM messages are exchanged using only a
       single exchange (only one request and one acknowledgement).
       Example (see Section 5.6.2): Whenever a DE-IPSP is taking the
       leading role to start communication to a peer DE-IPSP, it sends an
       ASP Up message to the peer DE-IPSP.  The peer MAY consider the
       initiating DE-IPSPs to be in ASP-INACTIVE state, as it already sent
       a message, and answer back with ASP Up Ack.  Upon receipt of this
       answer by the initiating DE-IPSP, it also MAY consider the peer to
       be in ASP-INACTIVE state, since it did respond.  Therefore, a
       second ASP Up message exchange to be started by the peer DE-IPSP
       could be avoided.  In this case, the receipt of ASP Up Ack will
       turn into a state change.
