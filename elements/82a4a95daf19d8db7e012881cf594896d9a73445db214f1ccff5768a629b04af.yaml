          (d) Install the new LSA in the link state database (replacing
              the current database copy).  This may cause the routing
              table calculation to be scheduled.  In addition, timestamp
              the new LSA with the current time (i.e., the time it was
              received).  The flooding procedure cannot overwrite the
              newly installed LSA until MinLSArrival seconds have elapsed.
              The LSA installation process is discussed further in Section
              13.2.
