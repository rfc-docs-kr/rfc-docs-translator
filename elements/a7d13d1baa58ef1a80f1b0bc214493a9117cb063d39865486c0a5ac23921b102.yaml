     To simplify translation between RADIUS and Diameter, Dynamic
     Authorization Clients can include a Service-Type Attribute with value
     "Authorize Only" within a CoA-Request; see Section 4 for details on
     Diameter considerations.  Support for a CoA-Request including a
     Service-Type Attribute with value "Authorize Only" is OPTIONAL on the
     NAS and Dynamic Authorization Client.  A Service-Type Attribute MUST
     NOT be included within a Disconnect-Request.
