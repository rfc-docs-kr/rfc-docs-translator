     o  Clarified routing fixes.  This document more clearly specifies
        what information (AVPs and Application Ids) can be used for making
        general routing decisions.  A rule for the prioritization of
        redirect routing criteria when multiple route entries are found
        via redirects has also been added (see Section 6.13).
