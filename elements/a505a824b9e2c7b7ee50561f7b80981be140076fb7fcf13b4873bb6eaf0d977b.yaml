     An address realm is a network domain in which the network addresses
     are uniquely assigned to entities such that datagrams can be routed
     to them. Routing protocols used within the network domain are
     responsible for finding routes to entities given their network
     addresses. Note that this document is limited to describing NAT in
     IPv4 environment and does not address the use of NAT in other types
     of environment. (e.g. IPv6 environments)
