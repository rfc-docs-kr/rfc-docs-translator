              In this state, the router has sent and received an entire
              sequence of Database Description Packets.  The only packets
              received should be duplicates (see above).  In particular,
              the packet's Options field should match the set of optional
              OSPF capabilities previously indicated by the neighbor
              (stored in the neighbor structure's Neighbor Options field).
              Any other packets received, including the reception of a
              packet with the Initialize(I) bit set, should generate the
              neighbor event SeqNumberMismatch.[8] Duplicates should be
              discarded by the master.  The slave must respond to
              duplicates by repeating the last Database Description packet
              that it had sent.
