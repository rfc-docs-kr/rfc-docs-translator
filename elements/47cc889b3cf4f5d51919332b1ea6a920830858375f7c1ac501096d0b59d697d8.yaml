                   An implementation may wish to reduce the overhead of
                   scanning the route cache for every datagram to be
                   transmitted.  This may be accomplished with a hash
                   table to speed the lookup, or by giving a connection-
                   oriented transport protocol a "hint" or temporary
                   handle on the appropriate cache entry, to be passed to
                   the IP layer with each subsequent datagram.
