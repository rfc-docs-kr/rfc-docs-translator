     At any time, either agent MAY generate a new offer that updates the
     session.  However, it MUST NOT generate a new offer if it has
     received an offer which it has not yet answered or rejected.
     Furthermore, it MUST NOT generate a new offer if it has generated a
     prior offer for which it has not yet received an answer or a
     rejection.  If an agent receives an offer after having sent one, but
     before receiving an answer to it, this is considered a "glare"
     condition.

  언제든지 두 에이전트는 세션을 업데이트하는 새로운 오퍼를 생성할 수 있습니다. 그러나 아직 답변하거나 거부하지 않은 오퍼를 받은 경우 새로운 오퍼를 생성해서는 안 됩니다. 또한 아직 답변이나 거부를 받지 않은 이전 오퍼를 생성한 경우 새로운 오퍼를 생성해서는 안 됩니다. 에이전트가 오퍼를 보낸 후 답변을 받기 전에 오퍼를 받으면 이는 "글레어" 조건으로 간주됩니다.
