                   Some TCP implementations send an MSS option only if the
                   destination host is on a non-connected network.
                   However, in general the TCP layer may not have the
                   appropriate information to make this decision, so it is
                   preferable to leave to the IP layer the task of
                   determining a suitable MTU for the Internet path.  We
                   therefore recommend that TCP always send the option (if
                   not 536) and that the IP layer determine MMS_R as
                   specified in 3.3.3 and 3.4.  A proposed IP-layer
                   mechanism to measure the MTU would then modify the IP
                   layer without changing TCP.
