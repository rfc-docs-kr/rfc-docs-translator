     The term "Implicit TLS" refers to the automatic negotiation of TLS
     whenever a TCP connection is made on a particular TCP port that is
     used exclusively by that server for TLS connections.  The term
     "Implicit TLS" is intended to contrast with the use of STARTTLS and
     similar commands in POP, IMAP, SMTP Message Submission, and other
     protocols, that are used by the client and the server to explicitly
     negotiate TLS on an established cleartext TCP connection.
