     Many people view traditional NAT router as a one-way (session)
     traffic filter, restricting sessions from external hosts into their
     machines. In addition, when address assignment in NAT router is done
     dynamically, that makes it harder for an attacker to point to any
     specific host in the NAT domain. NAT routers may be used in
     conjunction with firewalls to filter unwanted traffic.
