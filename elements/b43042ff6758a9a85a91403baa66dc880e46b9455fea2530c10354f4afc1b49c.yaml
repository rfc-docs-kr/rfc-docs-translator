          (4) If the new LSA was received on this interface, and the
              interface state is Backup (i.e., the router itself is the
              Backup Designated Router), examine the next interface.  The
              Designated Router will do the flooding on this interface.
              However, if the Designated Router fails the router (i.e.,
              the Backup Designated Router) will end up retransmitting the
              updates.
