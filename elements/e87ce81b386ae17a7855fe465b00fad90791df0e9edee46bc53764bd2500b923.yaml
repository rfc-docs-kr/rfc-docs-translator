          Several retransmitted LSAs may fit into a single Link State
          Update packet.  When LSAs are to be retransmitted, only the
          number fitting in a single Link State Update packet should be
          sent.  Another packet of retransmissions can be sent whenever
          some of the LSAs are acknowledged, or on the next firing of the
          retransmission timer.
