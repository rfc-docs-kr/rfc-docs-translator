     The authors wish to express appreciation to the other original
     authors of RFC 1519 (Kannan Varadhan, Jessica Yu); to the ROAD group,
     with whom many of the ideas behind CIDR were inspired and developed;
     and to the early reviewers of this re-spun version of the document
     (Barry Greene, Danny McPherson, Dave Meyer, Eliot Lear, Bill Norton,
     Ted Seely, Philip Smith, Pekka Savola), whose comments, corrections,
     and suggestions were invaluable.  We would especially like to thank
     Geoff Huston for contributions well above and beyond the call of
     duty.
