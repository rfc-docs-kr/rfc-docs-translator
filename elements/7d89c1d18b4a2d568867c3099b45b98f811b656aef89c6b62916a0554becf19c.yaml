     A wildcarding mechanism using two types of wildcards can be used with
     TerminationIDs.  The two wildcards are ALL and CHOOSE.  The former is
     used to address multiple Terminations at once, while the latter is
     used to indicate to a media gateway that it must select a Termination
     satisfying the partially specified TerminationID.  This allows, for
     instance, that a MGC instructs a MG to choose a circuit within a
     trunk group.
