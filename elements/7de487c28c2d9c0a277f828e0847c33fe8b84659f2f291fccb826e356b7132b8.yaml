     The authentication process MUST result in an authenticated client
     identity whose permissions are known to the server.  The
     authenticated identity of a client is commonly referred to as the
     NETCONF username.  The username is a string of characters that match
     the "Char" production from Section 2.2 of [W3C.REC-xml-20001006].
     The algorithm used to derive the username is transport protocol
     specific and in addition specific to the authentication mechanism
     used by the transport protocol.  The transport protocol MUST provide
     a username to be used by the other NETCONF layers.
