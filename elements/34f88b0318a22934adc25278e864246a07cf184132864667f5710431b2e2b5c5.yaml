     1.  The ChaCha20 cipher.  This is a high-speed cipher first described
         in [ChaCha].  It is considerably faster than AES in software-only
         implementations, making it around three times as fast on
         platforms that lack specialized AES hardware.  See Appendix B for
         some hard numbers.  ChaCha20 is also not sensitive to timing
         attacks (see the security considerations in Section 4).  This
         algorithm is described in Section 2.4
