     In the case of a Loadshare mode AS, the SGP moves the ASP to the
     ASP-INACTIVE state, and the AS traffic is reallocated across the
     remaining ASPs in the state ASP-ACTIVE, as per the loadsharing
     algorithm currently used within the AS.  A Notify message
     ("Insufficient ASP resources active in AS") MAY be sent to all
     inactive ASPs, if required.  An ASP Inactive Ack message is sent to
     the ASP after all traffic is halted, and Layer Management is informed
     with an M-ASP_INACTIVE indication primitive.
