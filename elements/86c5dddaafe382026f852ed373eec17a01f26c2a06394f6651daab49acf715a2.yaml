          Exchange
              In this state the router is describing its entire link state
              database by sending Database Description packets to the
              neighbor.  Each Database Description Packet has a DD
              sequence number, and is explicitly acknowledged.  Only one
              Database Description Packet is allowed outstanding at any
              one time.  In this state, Link State Request Packets may
              also be sent asking for the neighbor's more recent LSAs.
              All adjacencies in Exchange state or greater are used by the
              flooding procedure.  In fact, these adjacencies are fully
              capable of transmitting and receiving all types of OSPF
              routing protocol packets.
