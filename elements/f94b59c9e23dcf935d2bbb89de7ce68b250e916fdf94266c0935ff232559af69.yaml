          In a link-state routing protocol, each router maintains a
          database describing the Autonomous System's topology.  This
          database is referred to as the link-state database. Each
          participating router has an identical database.  Each individual
          piece of this database is a particular router's local state
          (e.g., the router's usable interfaces and reachable neighbors).
          The router distributes its local state throughout the Autonomous
          System by flooding.
