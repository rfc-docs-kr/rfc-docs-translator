     Network Address Translation is a method by which IP addresses are
     mapped from one realm to another, in an attempt to provide
     transparent routing to hosts. Traditionally, NAT devices are used to
     connect an isolated address realm with private unregistered addresses
     to an external realm with globally unique registered addresses. This
     document attempts to describe the operation of NAT devices and the
     associated considerations in general, and to define the terminology
     used to identify various flavors of NAT.
