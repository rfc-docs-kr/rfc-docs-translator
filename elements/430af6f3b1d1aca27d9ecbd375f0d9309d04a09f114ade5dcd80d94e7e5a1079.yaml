                   A careless implementation can send two or more
                   acknowledgment segments per data segment received.  For
                   example, suppose the receiver acknowledges every data
                   segment immediately.  When the application program
                   subsequently consumes the data and increases the
                   available receive buffer space again, the receiver may
                   send a second acknowledgment segment to update the
                   window at the sender.  The extreme case occurs with
                   single-character segments on TCP connections using the
                   Telnet protocol for remote login service.  Some
                   implementations have been observed in which each
                   incoming 1-character segment generates three return
                   segments: (1) the acknowledgment, (2) a one byte
                   increase in the window, and (3) the echoed character,
                   respectively.
