           DISCUSSION:
                The IP specification says that the reassembly timeout
                should be the remaining TTL from the IP header, but this
                does not work well because gateways generally treat TTL as
                a simple hop count rather than an elapsed time.  If the
                reassembly timeout is too small, datagrams will be
                discarded unnecessarily, and communication may fail.  The
                timeout needs to be at least as large as the typical
                maximum delay across the Internet.  A realistic minimum
                reassembly timeout would be 60 seconds.
