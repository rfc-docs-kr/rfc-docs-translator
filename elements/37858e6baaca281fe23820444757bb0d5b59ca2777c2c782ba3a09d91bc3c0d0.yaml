     The count action accumulates statistics pertaining to traffic passing
     through a given path through the policy.  It is intended to be useful
     for usage-based billing, for statistical studies, or for analysis of
     the behavior of a policy in a given network.  The objects in the
     Count Action are various counters and a discontinuity time.  The
     counters display the number of packets and bytes encountered on the
     path since the discontinuity time.  They share the same discontinuity
     time, which is the discontinuity time of the interface or agent.
