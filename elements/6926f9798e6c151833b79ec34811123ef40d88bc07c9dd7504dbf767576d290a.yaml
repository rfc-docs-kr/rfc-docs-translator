     To simplify translation between RADIUS and Diameter, Dynamic
     Authorization Clients can include a Service-Type Attribute with value
     "Authorize Only" within a CoA-Request, as described in Section 3.2.
     A Diameter/RADIUS gateway receiving a CoA-Request containing a
     Service-Type Attribute with a value "Authorize Only" translates this
     to a RAR with Re-Auth-Request-Type AVP with value "AUTHORIZE ONLY".
     The received RAA is then translated to a CoA-NAK with a Service-Type
     Attribute with value "Authorize Only".  If the Result-Code AVP in the
     RAA has a value in the success category, then an Error-Cause
     Attribute with value "Request Initiated" is included in the CoA-NAK.
     If the Result-Code AVP in the RAA has a value indicating a Protocol
     Error or a Transient or Permanent Failure, then an alternate Error-
     Cause Attribute is returned as suggested below.
