     When a NAT box x in stub partition X wishes to deliver a packet to
     stub partition Y, it will encapsulate the packet in an IP header with
     destination address set to the global address of NAT box y that has
     been reserved for encapsulation. When NAT box y receives a packet
     with that destination address, it decapsulates the IP header and
     routes the packet internally.  Note, there is no address translation
     in the process; merely transfer of private network packets over an
     external network tunnel backbone.
