          When a new AS-external-LSA is received, it is not necessary to
          recalculate the entire routing table.  Call the destination
          described by the AS-external-LSA N.  N's address is obtained by
          masking the LSA's Link State ID with the network/subnet mask
          contained in the body of the LSA. If there is already an intra-
          area or inter-area route to the destination, no recalculation is
          necessary (internal routes take precedence).
