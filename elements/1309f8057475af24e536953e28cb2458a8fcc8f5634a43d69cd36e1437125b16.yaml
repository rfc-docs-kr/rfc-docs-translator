     When a connection request is received from a Diameter peer, it is
     not, in the general case, possible to know the identity of that peer
     until a CER is received from it.  This is because host and port
     determine the identity of a Diameter peer; the source port of an
     incoming connection is arbitrary.  Upon receipt of a CER, the
     identity of the connecting peer can be uniquely determined from the
     Origin-Host.
