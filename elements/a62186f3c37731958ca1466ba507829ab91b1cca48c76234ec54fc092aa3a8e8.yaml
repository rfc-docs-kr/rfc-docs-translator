     timer or the long (L) timer for subsequent events, over-riding the
     timing rules described above.  If an explicit timing specifier is in
     effect in one alternative event sequence, but none is given in any
     other candidate alternative, the timer value set by the explicit
     timing specifier must be used.  If all sequences with explicit timing
     controls are dropped from the candidate set, timing reverts to the
     default rules given above.  Finally, if conflicting timing specifiers
     are in effect in different alternative sequences, the results are
     undefined.
