     Warning: Completely anonymous connections only provide protection
              against passive eavesdropping.  Unless an independent
              tamper-proof channel is used to verify that the finished
              messages were not replaced by an attacker, server
              authentication is required in environments where active
              man-in-the-middle attacks are a concern.
