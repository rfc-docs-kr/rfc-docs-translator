          These graphs are shown in Figure 10.  It is assumed that Router
          RT7 has become the Designated Router, and Router RT3 the Backup
          Designated Router, for the Network N2.  The Backup Designated
          Router performs a lesser function during the flooding procedure
          than the Designated Router (see Section 13.3).  This is the
          reason for the dashed lines connecting the Backup Designated
          Router RT3.
