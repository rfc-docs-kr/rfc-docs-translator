          ExternalRoutingCapability
              Whether AS-external-LSAs will be flooded into/throughout the
              area.  If AS-external-LSAs are excluded from the area, the
              area is called a "stub".  Internal to stub areas, routing to
              external destinations will be based solely on a default
              summary route.  The backbone cannot be configured as a stub
              area.  Also, virtual links cannot be configured through stub
              areas.  For more information, see Section 3.6.
