     To support partial frame decoding, the frame is broken into "chunks"
     each containing an integral number of restart intervals. The Restart
     Count field contains the position of the first restart interval in
     the current "chunk" so that receivers know which part of the frame
     this data corresponds to.  A Restart Interval value SHOULD be chosen
     to allow a "chunk" to completely fit within a single packet.  In this
     case, both the F and L bits of the packet are set to 1.  However, if
     a chunk needs to be spread across multiple packets, the F bit will be
     set to 1 in the first packet of the chunk (and only that one) and the
     L bit will be set to 1 in the last packet of the chunk (and only that
     one).
