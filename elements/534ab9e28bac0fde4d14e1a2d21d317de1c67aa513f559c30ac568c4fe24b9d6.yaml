     Feeds MUST use UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding.  Lines are
     delimited by a line break (CRLF) (as specified in [RFC4180]), and
     blank lines are ignored.  Text from a '#' character to the end of the
     current line is treated as a comment only and is similarly ignored
     (note that this does not strictly follow [RFC4180], which has no
     support for comments).

  피드는 UTF-8 [RFC3629] 문자 인코딩을 사용해야 합니다. 줄은 줄 바꿈(CRLF)으로 구분됩니다([RFC4180]에 지정됨). 빈 줄은 무시됩니다. '#' 문자부터 현재 줄 끝까지의 텍스트는 주석으로만 처리되며 마찬가지로 무시됩니다(이는 주석을 지원하지 않는 [RFC4180]을 엄격히 따르지 않는다는 점에 유의하세요).
