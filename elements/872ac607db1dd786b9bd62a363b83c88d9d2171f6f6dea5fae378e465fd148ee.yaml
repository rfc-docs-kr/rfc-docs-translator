     Different environments have different security requirements and
     therefore would deploy different security policies.  This section
     discusses some of the security policies that may be implemented by
     syslog transport receivers and syslog transport senders.  The
     security policies describe the requirements for authentication and
     authorization.  The list of policies in this section is not
     exhaustive and other policies MAY be implemented.
