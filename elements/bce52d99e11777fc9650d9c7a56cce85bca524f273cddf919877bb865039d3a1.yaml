      InfTransDelay
          The estimated number of seconds it takes to transmit a Link
          State Update Packet over this interface.  LSAs contained in the
          Link State Update packet will have their age incremented by this
          amount before transmission.  This value should take into account
          transmission and propagation delays; it must be greater than
          zero.
