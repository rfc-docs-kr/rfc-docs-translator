     -  Extract the Sender TTL value from the TTL/Hop Limit value of
        received packets.  Session-Reflector implementations SHOULD fetch
        the TTL/Hop Limit value from the IP header of the packet,
        replacing the value of 255 set by the Session-Sender.  If an
        implementation does not fetch the actual TTL value (the only good
        reason not to do so is an inability to access the TTL field of
        arriving packets), it MUST set the Sender TTL value as 255.
