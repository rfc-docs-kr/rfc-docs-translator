              AGGREGATOR is an optional transitive attribute of length 6.
              The attribute contains the last AS number that formed the
              aggregate route (encoded as 2 octets), followed by the IP
              address of the BGP speaker that formed the aggregate route
              (encoded as 4 octets).  This SHOULD be the same address as
              the one used for the BGP Identifier of the speaker.
