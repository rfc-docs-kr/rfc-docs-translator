     Below, the semantics of the local and remote descriptors are
     specified in detail.  The specification consists of two parts.  The
     first part specifies the interpretation of the contents of the
     descriptor.  The second part specifies the actions the MG must take
     upon receiving the local and remote descriptors.  The actions to be
     taken by the MG depend on the values of the ReserveValue and
     ReserveGroup properties of the LocalControl descriptor.
