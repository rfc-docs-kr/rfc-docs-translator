                      Otherwise, the attached network is a broadcast or
                      NBMA network and the router is eligible to become
                      Designated Router.  In this case, in an attempt to
                      discover the attached network's Designated Router
                      the interface state is set to Waiting and the single
                      shot Wait Timer is started.  Additionally, if the
                      network is an NBMA network examine the configured
                      list of neighbors for this interface and generate
                      the neighbor event Start for each neighbor that is
                      also eligible to become Designated Router.
