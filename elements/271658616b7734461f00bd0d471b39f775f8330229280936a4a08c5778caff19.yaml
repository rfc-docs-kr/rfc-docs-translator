                   However, the observed patterns of datagram loss in the
                   Internet do not favor the probability of retransmitted
                   fragments filling reassembly gaps, while other
                   mechanisms (e.g., TCP repacketizing upon
                   retransmission) tend to prevent retransmission of an
                   identical datagram [IP:9].  Therefore, we believe that
                   retransmitting the same Identification field is not
                   useful.  Also, a connectionless transport protocol like
                   UDP would require the cooperation of the application
                   programs to retain the same Identification value in
                   identical datagrams.
