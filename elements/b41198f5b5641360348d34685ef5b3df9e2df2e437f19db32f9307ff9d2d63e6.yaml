          Routers RT5 and RT7 are AS boundary routers.  Intra-area routes
          have been calculated to Routers RT5 and RT7.  This allows
          external routes to be calculated to the destinations advertised
          by RT5 and RT7 (i.e., Networks N12, N13, N14 and N15).  It is
          assumed all AS-external-LSAs originated by RT5 and RT7 are
          advertising type 1 external metrics.  This results in type 1
          external paths being calculated to destinations N12-N15.
