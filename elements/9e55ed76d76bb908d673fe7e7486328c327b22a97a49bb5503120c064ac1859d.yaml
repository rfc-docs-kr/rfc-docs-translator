        The environments are defined as follows:
        -  "Highly protected environment": Networks that are protected
           either with encryption devices approved by NSA for protection
           of classified data or via physical isolation, and that are
           certified for processing system-high classified data, where
           exposure of unencrypted data is limited to U.S. citizens
           holding appropriate security clearances.
        -  "Moderately protected environment":
           -- Physically isolated unclassified, unencrypted networks in
              which access is restricted based on legitimate need.
           -- Networks protected by NSA-approved, type 1 encryption,
              accessible by U.S.-authorized foreign nationals.
        -  "Minimally protected environments": Unencrypted networks
           connected to either the Internet or NIPRNET, either directly or
           via a firewall.
