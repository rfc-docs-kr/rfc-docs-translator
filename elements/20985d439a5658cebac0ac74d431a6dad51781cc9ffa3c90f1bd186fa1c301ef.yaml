     As with host-centric topologies, defining just a node graph will not
     be enough for most ICN studies.  The experimenter should also clearly
     define and list the respective matrices that correspond to the
     network, storage, and computation capacities available at each node
     as well as the delay characteristics of each link [Montage].  Real
     values for such parameters can be taken from existing platforms such
     as iPlane (http://iplane.cs.washington.edu).  Synthetic values could
     be produced with specific tools [Kaune09].
