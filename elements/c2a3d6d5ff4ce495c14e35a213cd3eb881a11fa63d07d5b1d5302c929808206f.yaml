      The OSPF protocol was developed by the OSPF working group of the
      Internet Engineering Task Force.  It has been designed expressly for
      the TCP/IP internet environment, including explicit support for CIDR
      and the tagging of externally-derived routing information.  OSPF
      also provides for the authentication of routing updates, and
      utilizes IP multicast when sending/receiving the updates.  In
      addition, much work has been done to produce a protocol that
      responds quickly to topology changes, yet involves small amounts of
      routing protocol traffic.
