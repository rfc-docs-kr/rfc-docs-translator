     Not all applications lend themselves easily to translation by NAT
     devices; especially those that include IP addresses and TCP/UDP ports
     in the payload. Application Level Gateways (ALGs) are application
     specific translation agents that allow an application on a host in
     one address realm to connect to its counterpart running on a host in
     different realm transparently. An ALG may interact with NAT to set up
     state, use NAT state information, modify application specific payload
     and perform whatever else is necessary to get the application running
     across disparate address realms.
