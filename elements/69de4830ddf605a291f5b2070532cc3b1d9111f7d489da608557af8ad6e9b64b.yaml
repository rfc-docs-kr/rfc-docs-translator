     Quantification of network performance requires a set of standard
     metrics.  These metrics should be broad enough so they can be applied
     equally to host-centric and information-centric (or other) networks.
     This will allow reasoning about a certain ICN approach in relation to
     an earlier version of the same approach, to another ICN approach, or
     to the incumbent host-centric approach.  It will therefore be less
     difficult to gauge optimization and research direction.  On the other
     hand, the metrics should be targeted to network performance only and
     should avoid unnecessary expansion into the physical and application
     layers.  Similarly, at this point, it is more important to capture as
     metrics only the main figures of merit and to leave more esoteric and
     less frequent cases for the future.
