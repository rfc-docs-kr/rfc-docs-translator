              DISCUSSION:
                   While the TOS field has been little used in the past,
                   it is expected to play an increasing role in the near
                   future.  The TOS field is expected to be used to
                   control two aspects of gateway operations: routing and
                   queueing algorithms.  See Section 2 of [INTRO:1] for
                   the requirements on application programs to specify TOS
                   values.
