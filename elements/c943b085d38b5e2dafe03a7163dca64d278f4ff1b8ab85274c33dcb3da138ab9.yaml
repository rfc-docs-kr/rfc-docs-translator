     The resolvers on all internal hosts, both public and private, query
     only the internal nameserver.  The external server resolves queries
     from resolvers outside the enterprise and is linked into the global
     DNS.  The internal server forwards all queries for information
     outside the enterprise to the external nameserver, so all internal
     hosts can access the global DNS.  This ensures that information about
     private hosts does not reach resolvers and nameservers outside the
     enterprise.
