     The algorithm name is "ChaCha".  "ChaCha20" is a specific instance
     where 20 "rounds" (or 80 quarter rounds -- see Section 2.1) are used.
     Other variations are defined, with 8 or 12 rounds, but in this
     document we only describe the 20-round ChaCha, so the names "ChaCha"
     and "ChaCha20" will be used interchangeably.
