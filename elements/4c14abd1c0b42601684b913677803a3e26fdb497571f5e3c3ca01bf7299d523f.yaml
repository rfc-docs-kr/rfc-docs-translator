     $ BLACK/Crypto/RED (BCR)
        (N) An experimental, end-to-end, network packet encryption system
        developed in a working prototype form by BBN and the Collins Radio
        division of Rockwell Corporation in the 1975-1980 time frame for
        the U.S. DoD. BCR was the first network security system to support
        TCP/IP traffic, and it incorporated the first DES chips that were
        validated by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (now called
        NIST). BCR also was the first to use a KDC and an ACC to manage
        connections.

  $ BLACK/Crypto/RED(BCR) - (N) 1975~1980년에 Rockwell Corporation의 Collins Radio 사업부와 BBN이 작업 프로토타입 형식으로 개발한 실험적인 종단 간 네트워크 패킷 암호화 시스템입니다. 미국 국방부. BCR은 TCP/IP 트래픽을 지원하는 최초의 네트워크 보안 시스템이었으며 미국 국립표준국(현재 NIST)에서 검증한 최초의 DES 칩을 통합했습니다. BCR은 또한 KDC와 ACC를 사용하여 연결을 관리한 최초의 회사이기도 합니다.
