     Whenever an ASP in a Broadcast mode AS becomes ASP-ACTIVE, the SGP
     MUST tag the first DATA message broadcast in each traffic flow with a
     unique Correlation Id parameter.  The purpose of this Id is to permit
     the newly active ASP to synchronize its processing of traffic in each
     traffic flow with the other ASPs in the broadcast group.
