     Integrity protection
        This refers to providing data origin authentication and protection
        against unauthorized modification of information for EAP packets
        (including EAP Requests and Responses).  When making this claim, a
        method specification MUST describe the EAP packets and fields
        within the EAP packet that are protected.
