     If a required descriptor other than the Audit descriptor is
     unspecified (i.e., entirely absent) from a command, the previous
     values set in that descriptor for that termination, if any, are
     retained.  A missing Audit descriptor is equivalent to an empty Audit
     Descriptor.  The behavior of the MG with respect to unspecified
     parameters within a descriptor varies with the descriptor concerned,
     as indicated in succeeding sections.  Whenever a parameter is
     underspecified or overspecified, the descriptor containing the value
     chosen by the responder is included as output from the command.
