     Although Internet routing domains are not required to use routing
     protocols capable of propagating CIDR routes, the topology such
     routing domains can support will be somewhat limited.  In particular,
     the non-CIDR-capable parts of the Internet will need to default
     towards the CIDR-capable parts of the Internet for routes which have
     been aggregated to non-network boundaries.
