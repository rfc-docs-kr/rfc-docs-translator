     A server that supports this specification SHALL send a
     "delegated_credential" extension in the CertificateRequest message
     when requesting client authentication.  The body of the extension
     consists of a SignatureSchemeList.  If the server receives a
     delegated credential without having indicated support in its
     CertificateRequest, then the server MUST abort with an
     "unexpected_message" alert.
