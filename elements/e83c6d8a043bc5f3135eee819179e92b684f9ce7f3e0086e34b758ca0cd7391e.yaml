        In our example, let's suppose that the XYZ corporation has a
        single connection to a regional, and has therefore uses the IP
        address space from the space given to that regional.  Similarly,
        let's suppose that MBII, as an international corporation with
        connections to six different providers, has chosen the second
        solution from Section 5.4, and therefore has obtained six
        different address allocations. In this case, all addresses
        reachable in the XYZ Corporation can be described by a single
        address prefix (implying that router M only needs to be configured
        with a single address prefix to represent the addresses reachable
        over this link). All addresses reachable in MBII can be described
        by six address prefixes (implying that router X needs to be
        configured with six address prefixes to represent the addresses
        reachable over the link).
