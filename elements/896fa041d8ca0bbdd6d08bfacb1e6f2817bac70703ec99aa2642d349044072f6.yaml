     To perform the RPF check, the Dynamic Authorization Server uses the
     session identification attributes included in Disconnect-Request or
     CoA-Request packets, in order to determine the RADIUS server(s) to
     which an equivalent Access-Request could be routed.  If the source
     address of the Disconnect-Request or CoA-Request is within this set,
     then the CoA-Request or Disconnect-Request is forwarded; otherwise it
     MUST be silently discarded.
