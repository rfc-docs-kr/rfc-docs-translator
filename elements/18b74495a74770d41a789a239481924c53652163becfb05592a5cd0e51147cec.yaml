     In the early days of the Internet, IPv4 address space assignment was
     performed by the central Network Information Center (NIC).  Class
     A/B/C network numbers were assigned in essentially arbitrary order,
     roughly according to the size of the organizations that requested
     them.  All assignments were recorded centrally, and no attempt was
     made to assign network numbers in a manner that would allow routing
     aggregation.
