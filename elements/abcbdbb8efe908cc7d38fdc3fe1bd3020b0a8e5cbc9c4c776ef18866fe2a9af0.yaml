      Attached Router
          The Router IDs of each of the routers attached to the network.
          Actually, only those routers that are fully adjacent to the
          Designated Router are listed.  The Designated Router includes
          itself in this list.  The number of routers included can be
          deduced from the LSA header's length field.
