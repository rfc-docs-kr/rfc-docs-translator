         *  The value that is hashed together with the salt value is the
            string (0x)00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 || mHash rather than the
            message M itself.  Here, mHash is the hash of M.  Note that
            the hash function is the same in both steps.  See Note 3 below
            for further discussion.  (Also, the name "salt" is used
            instead of "seed", as it is more reflective of the value's
            role.)
