     The domain which has been allocated a range of addresses has the sole
     authority for aggregation of its address space.  In the usual case,
     the AS will install manual configuration commands in its border
     routers to aggregate some portion of its address space.  An domain
     can also delegate aggregation authority to another domain.  In this
     case, aggregation is done in the other domain by one of its border
     routers.
