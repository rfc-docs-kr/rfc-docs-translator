     In the binary encoding, if only the firstAck is present in a
     response acknowledgement (see Annex A.2), only one transaction is
     acknowledged.  If both firstAck and lastAck are present, then the
     range of transactions from firstAck to lastAck is acknowledged.  In
     the text encoding, a horizontal dash is used to indicate a range of
     transactions being acknowledged (see Annex B.2).
