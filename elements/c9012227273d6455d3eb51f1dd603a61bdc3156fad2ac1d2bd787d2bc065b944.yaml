     Relays may, for example, be used to aggregate requests from multiple
     Network Access Servers (NASes) within a common geographical area
     (Point of Presence, POP).  The use of relays is advantageous since it
     eliminates the need for NASes to be configured with the necessary
     security information they would otherwise require to communicate with
     Diameter servers in other realms.  Likewise, this reduces the
     configuration load on Diameter servers that would otherwise be
     necessary when NASes are added, changed, or deleted.
