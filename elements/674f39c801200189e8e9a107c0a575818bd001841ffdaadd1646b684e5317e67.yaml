        8.  RFC 2617 notes that a cnonce value MUST NOT be sent in an
            Authorization (and by extension Proxy-Authorization) header
            field if no qop directive has been sent.  Therefore, any
            algorithms that have a dependency on the cnonce (including
            "MD5-Sess") require that the qop directive be sent.  Use of
            the "qop" parameter is optional in RFC 2617 for the purposes
            of backwards compatibility with RFC 2069; since RFC 2543 was
            based on RFC 2069, the "qop" parameter must unfortunately
            remain optional for clients and servers to receive.  However,
            servers MUST always send a "qop" parameter in WWW-Authenticate
            and Proxy-Authenticate header field values.  If a client
            receives a "qop" parameter in a challenge header field, it
            MUST send the "qop" parameter in any resulting authorization
            header field.
