     A host's claim on an IPv4 Link-Local address is valid only as long as
     that host remains connected to the link, actively defending against
     probes for its chosen address.  As soon as a host shuts down, sleeps,
     or otherwise disconnects from a link, it immediately relinquishes any
     claim it may have had on any IPv4 Link-Local address on that link.  A
     host wishing to reclaim a previously used IPv4 Link-Local address
     MUST perform the full probing and announcement process required by
     "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses" [RFC3927] and
     MUST NOT attempt to use DNAv4 as a shortcut to bypass that process.
