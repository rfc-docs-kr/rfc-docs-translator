              DISCUSSION:
                   It is extremely important to remember that ACK
                   (acknowledgment) segments that contain no data are not
                   reliably transmitted by TCP.  If zero window probing is
                   not supported, a connection may hang forever when an
                   ACK segment that re-opens the window is lost.
