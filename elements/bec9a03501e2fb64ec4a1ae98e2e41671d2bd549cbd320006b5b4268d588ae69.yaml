          In order to get better aggregation at area boundaries, area
          address ranges can be employed (see Section C.2 for more
          details).  Each address range is defined as an [address,mask]
          pair.  Many separate networks may then be contained in a single
          address range, just as a subnetted network is composed of many
          separate subnets.  Area border routers then summarize the area
          contents (for distribution to the backbone) by advertising a
          single route for each address range.  The cost of the route is
          the maximum cost to any of the networks falling in the specified
          range.
