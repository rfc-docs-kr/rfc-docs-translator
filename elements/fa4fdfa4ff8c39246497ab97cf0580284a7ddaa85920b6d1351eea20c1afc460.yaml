     This document defines the protocol used between elements of a
     physically decomposed multimedia gateway.  There are no functional
     differences from a system view between a decomposed gateway, with
     distributed sub-components potentially on more than one physical
     device, and a monolithic gateway such as described in H.246. This
     document does not define how gateways, multipoint control units or
     interactive voice response units (IVRs) work.  Instead it creates a
     general framework that is suitable for these applications.
