      There are at least two ways to support multiple physical interfaces
      to the same IP subnet. Both methods will interoperate with
      implementations of RFC 1583 (and of course this memo). The two
      methods are sketched briefly below. An assumption has been made that
      each interface has been assigned a separate IP address (otherwise,
      support for multiple interfaces is more of a link-level or ARP issue
      than an OSPF issue).
