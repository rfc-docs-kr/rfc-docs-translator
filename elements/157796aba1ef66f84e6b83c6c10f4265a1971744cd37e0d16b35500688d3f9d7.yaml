         While methods such as EAP-TLS [RFC2716] support fragmentation and
         reassembly, EAP methods originally designed for use within PPP
         where a 1500 octet MTU is guaranteed for control frames (see
         [RFC1661], Section 6.1) may lack fragmentation and reassembly
         features.
