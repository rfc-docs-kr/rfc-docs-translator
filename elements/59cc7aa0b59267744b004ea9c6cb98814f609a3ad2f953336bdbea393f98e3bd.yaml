     The SMTP client and server should note carefully the result of the
     TLS negotiation.  If the negotiation results in no privacy, or if it
     results in privacy using algorithms or key lengths that are deemed
     not strong enough, or if the authentication is not good enough for
     either party, the client may choose to end the SMTP session with an
     immediate QUIT command, or the server may choose to not accept any
     more SMTP commands.
