        There is at least one situation in which this third approach is
        particularly appropriate. Suppose that a special interest group of
        organizations have deployed their own backbone. For example, lets
        suppose that the U.S. National Widget Manufacturers and
        Researchers have set up a U.S.-wide backbone, which is used by
        corporations who manufacture widgets, and certain universities
        which are known for their widget research efforts. We can expect
        that the various organizations which are in the widget group will
        run their internal networks as separate routing domains, and most
        of them will also be attached to other TRDs (since most of the
        organizations involved in widget manufacture and research will
        also be involved in other activities). We can therefore expect
        that many or most of the organizations in the widget group are
        dual-homed, with one attachment for widget-associated
        communications and the other attachment for other types of
        communications. Let's also assume that the total number of
        organizations involved in the widget group is small enough that it
        is reasonable to maintain a routing table containing one entry per
        organization, but that they are distributed throughout a larger
