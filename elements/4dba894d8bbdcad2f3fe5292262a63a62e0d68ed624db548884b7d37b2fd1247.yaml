     Certificate     A type that binds a subject entity's distinguished
                     name to a public key with a digital signature.  This
                     type is defined in X.509.  This type also contains
                     the distinguished name of the certificate issuer (the
                     signer), an issuer-specific serial number, the
                     issuer's signature algorithm identifier, a validity
                     period, and an optional set of certificate
                     extensions.
