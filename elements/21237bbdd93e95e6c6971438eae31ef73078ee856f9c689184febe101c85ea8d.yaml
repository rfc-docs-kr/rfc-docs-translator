        One problem with the second solution is that backup routes to
        multi-homed organizations are not automatically maintained. With
        the first solution, each TRD, in announcing the ability to reach
        MBII, specifies that it is able to reach all of the hosts within
        MBII. With the second solution, each TRD announces that it can
        reach all of the hosts based on its own address prefix, which only
        includes some of the hosts within MBII. If the connection between
        MBII and one particular TRD were severed, then the hosts within
        MBII with addresses based on that TRD would become unreachable via
        inter-domain routing. The impact of this problem can be reduced
        somewhat by maintenance of additional information within routing
        tables, but this reduces the scaling advantage of the second
        approach.
