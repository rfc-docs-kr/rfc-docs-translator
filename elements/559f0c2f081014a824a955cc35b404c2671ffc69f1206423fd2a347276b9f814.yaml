              o   The initialize(I) and master(MS) bits are off, the
                  packet's DD sequence number equals the neighbor data
                  structure's DD sequence number (indicating
                  acknowledgment) and the neighbor's Router ID is smaller
                  than the router's own.  In this case the router is
                  Master.
