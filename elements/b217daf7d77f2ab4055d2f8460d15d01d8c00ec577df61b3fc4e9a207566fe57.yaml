     [d] The contents of the DHCP Client Identifier option that the client
         used to obtain the candidate configuration is different from the
         DHCP Client Identifier option the client intends to present on
         the interface in question.  In this case, it is anticipated that
         a DHCP server would NAK any request made by the client to acquire
         or extend the candidate configuration, since the two interfaces
         are presenting differing identities.
