     Notice how, in test vector #2, r is equal to zero.  The part of the
     Poly1305 algorithm where the accumulator is multiplied by r means
     that with r equal zero, the tag will be equal to s regardless of the
     content of the text.  Fortunately, all the proposed methods of
     generating r are such that getting this particular weak key is very
     unlikely.
