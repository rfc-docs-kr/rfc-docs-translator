        Tutorial: Multics was one of the first large, general-purpose,
        operating systems to include security as a primary goal from the
        inception of the design and development and was rated in TCSEC
        Class B2. Its many innovative hardware and software security
        mechanisms (e.g., protection ring) were adopted by later systems.
