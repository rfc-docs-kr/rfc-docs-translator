     The optional ServiceChangeDelay parameter is expressed in seconds. If
     the delay is absent or set to zero, the delay value should be
     considered to be null.  In the case of a "graceful"
     ServiceChangeMethod, a null delay indicates that the Media Gateway
     Controller should wait for the natural removal of existing
     connections and should not establish new connections.  For "graceful"
     only, a null delay means the MG must not set serviceState "out of
     service" until the termination is in the null context.
