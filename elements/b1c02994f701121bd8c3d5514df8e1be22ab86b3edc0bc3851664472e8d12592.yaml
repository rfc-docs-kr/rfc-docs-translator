          Each LSA specified in the Link State Request packet should be
          located in the router's database, and copied into Link State
          Update packets for transmission to the neighbor.  These LSAs
          should NOT be placed on the Link state retransmission list for
          the neighbor.  If an LSA cannot be found in the database,
          something has gone wrong with the Database Exchange process, and
          neighbor event BadLSReq should be generated.
