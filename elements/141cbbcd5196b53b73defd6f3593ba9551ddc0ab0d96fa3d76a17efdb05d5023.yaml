     The problem of how best to send a broadcast has been extensively
     discussed [1, 3, 4, 14, 15].  Since we assume that the problem has
     already been solved at the data link layer, an IP host wishing to
     send either a local broadcast or a directed broadcast need only
     specify the appropriate destination address and send the datagram as
     usual.  Any sophisticated algorithms need only reside in gateways.
