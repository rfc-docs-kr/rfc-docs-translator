     User-configurable MUAs SHOULD support the use of [RFC6186] for
     account setup.  However, when using configuration information
     obtained via this method, MUAs SHOULD ignore advertised services that
     do not satisfy minimum confidentiality requirements, unless the user
     has explicitly requested reduced confidentiality.  This will have the
     effect of causing the MUA to default to ignoring advertised
     configurations that do not support TLS, even when those advertised
     configurations have a higher priority than other advertised
     configurations.
