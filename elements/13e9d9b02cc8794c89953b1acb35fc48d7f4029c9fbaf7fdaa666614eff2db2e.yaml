              If the forwarding address is set to 0.0.0.0, packets should
              be sent to the ASBR itself. Among the multiple routing table
              entries for the ASBR, select the preferred entry as follows.
              If RFC1583Compatibility is set to "disabled", prune the set
              of routing table entries for the ASBR as described in
              Section 16.4.1. In any case, among the remaining routing
              table entries, select the routing table entry with the least
              cost; when there are multiple least cost routing table
              entries the entry whose associated area has the largest OSPF
              Area ID (when considered as an unsigned 32-bit integer) is
              chosen.
