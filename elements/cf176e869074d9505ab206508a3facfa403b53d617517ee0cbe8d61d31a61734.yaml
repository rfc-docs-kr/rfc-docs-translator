        The greatest burden in transmitting and operating on routing
        information is at the top of the routing hierarchy, where routing
        information tends to accumulate. In the Internet, for example,
        providers must manage the set of network numbers for all networks
        reachable through the provider. Traffic destined for other
        providers is generally routed to the backbones (which act as
        providers as well).  The backbones, however, must be cognizant of
        the network numbers for all attached providers and their
        associated networks.
