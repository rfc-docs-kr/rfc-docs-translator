              (5) The 32-bit Cryptographic sequence number (see Figure 18)
                  is set to a non-decreasing value (i.e., a value at least
                  as large as the last value sent out the interface). The
                  precise values to use in the cryptographic sequence
                  number field are implementation-specific. For example,
                  it may be based on a simple counter, or be based on the
                  system's clock.
