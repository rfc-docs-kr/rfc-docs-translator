        State changes resulting from a CoA-Request MUST be atomic: if the
        CoA-Request is successful for all matching sessions, the NAS MUST
        send a CoA-ACK in reply, and all requested authorization changes
        MUST be made.  If the CoA-Request is unsuccessful for any matching
        sessions, the NAS MUST send a CoA-NAK in reply, and the requested
        authorization changes MUST NOT be made for any of the matching
        sessions.  Similarly, a state change MUST NOT occur as a result of
        a Disconnect-Request that is unsuccessful with respect to any of
        the matching sessions; a NAS MUST send a Disconnect-NAK in reply
        if any of the matching sessions cannot be successfully terminated.
        A NAS that does not support dynamic authorization changes applying
        to multiple sessions MUST send a CoA-NAK or Disconnect-NAK in
        reply; an Error-Cause Attribute with value 508 (Multiple Session
        Selection Unsupported) SHOULD be included.
