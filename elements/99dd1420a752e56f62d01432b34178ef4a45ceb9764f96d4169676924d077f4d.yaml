     The criteria for Accept/Reject decisions or the reasons for choosing
     particular authorizations are typically not communicated to the
     authenticator, only the final result is.  As a result, the
     authenticator has no way to know on what the decision was based.  Was
     a set of authorization parameters sent because this service is always
     provided to the user, or was the decision based on the time of day
     and the capabilities of the authenticator?

  승인/거부 결정 기준이나 특정 권한 부여를 선택하는 이유는 일반적으로 인증자에게 전달되지 않으며 최종 결과만 전달됩니다. 결과적으로 인증자는 결정의 근거가 무엇인지 알 수 없습니다. 이 서비스가 항상 사용자에게 제공되기 때문에 일련의 인증 매개변수가 전송되었습니까? 아니면 시간과 인증자의 기능을 기반으로 결정되었습니까?
