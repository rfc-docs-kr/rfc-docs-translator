     In IEEE 802 media, initial key activation also typically occurs after
     completion of EAP authentication.  Therefore an initial EAP exchange
     typically cannot be protected by the lower layer ciphersuite,
     although an EAP re-authentication or pre-authentication exchange can
     be protected.
