               An option definition may specify a range of permissible
               numbers of bytes; if it has a choice, a sender SHOULD
               represent the integer with as few bytes as possible, i.e.,
               without leading zero bytes.  For example, the number 0 is
               represented with an empty option value (a zero-length
               sequence of bytes) and the number 1 by a single byte with
               the numerical value of 1 (bit combination 00000001 in most
               significant bit first notation).  A recipient MUST be
               prepared to process values with leading zero bytes.
