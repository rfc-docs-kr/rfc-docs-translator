     The 421 (Misdirected Request) status code indicates that the request
     was directed at a server that is unable or unwilling to produce an
     authoritative response for the target URI.  An origin server (or
     gateway acting on behalf of the origin server) sends 421 to reject a
     target URI that does not match an origin for which the server has
     been configured (Section 4.3.1) or does not match the connection
     context over which the request was received (Section 7.4).

  421(잘못된 요청) 상태 코드는 요청이 대상 URI에 대한 신뢰할 수 있는 응답을 생성할 수 없거나 생성할 의사가 없는 서버로 전달되었음을 나타냅니다. 원본 서버(또는 원본 서버를 대신하여 작동하는 게이트웨이)는 서버가 구성된 원본(섹션 4.3.1)과 일치하지 않거나 연결 컨텍스트와 일치하지 않는 대상 URI를 거부하기 위해 421을 보냅니다. 요청이 수신되었습니다(섹션 7.4).
