                   At the receiver, the PSH bit forces buffered data to be
                   delivered to the application (even if less than a full
                   buffer has been received). Conversely, the lack of a
                   PSH bit can be used to avoid unnecessary wakeup calls
                   to the application process; this can be an important
                   performance optimization for large timesharing hosts.
                   Passing the PSH bit to the receiving application allows
                   an analogous optimization within the application.
