     One of the risks of deploying a short-lived credential system based
     on absolute time is client clock skew.  If a client's clock is
     sufficiently ahead of or behind the server's clock, then clients will
     reject delegated credentials that are valid from the server's
     perspective.  Clock skew also affects the validity of the original
     certificates.  The lifetime of the delegated credential should be set
     taking clock skew into account.  Clock skew may affect a delegated
     credential at the beginning and end of its validity periods, which
     should also be taken into account.
