     When the proxy receives a response to a CoA-Request or Disconnect-
     Request, it MUST remove its own Proxy-State Attribute (the last
     Proxy-State in the packet) before forwarding the response.  Since
     Disconnect and CoA responses are authenticated on the entire packet
     contents, the stripping of the Proxy-State Attribute invalidates the
     integrity check, so the proxy MUST recompute it.
