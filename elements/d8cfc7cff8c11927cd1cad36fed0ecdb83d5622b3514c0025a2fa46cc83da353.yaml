     Alternatively, the SGP may move the ASP into a pool of Inactive ASPs
     available for future configuration within Application Servers,
     determined in a subsequent Registration Request or ASP Active
     procedure.  If the ASP Up message contains an ASP Identifier, the SGP
     should save the ASP Identifier for that ASP.  The SGP MUST send an
     ASP Up Ack message in response to a received ASP Up message even if
     the ASP is already marked as ASP-INACTIVE at the SGP.
