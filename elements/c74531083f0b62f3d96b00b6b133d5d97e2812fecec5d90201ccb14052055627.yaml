        However, there are additional considerations for routing domains
        which are attached to multiple providers. Such "multi-homed"
        routing domains may, for example, consist of single-site campuses
        and companies which are attached to multiple backbones, large
        organizations which are attached to different providers at
        different locations in the same country, or multi-national
        organizations which are attached to backbones in a variety of
        countries worldwide. There are a number of possible ways to deal
        with these multi-homed routing domains.
