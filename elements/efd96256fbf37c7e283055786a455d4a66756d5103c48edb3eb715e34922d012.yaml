        o    Organizations which are multi-homed. Because multi-homed
             organizations must be advertised into the system by each of
             their service providers, it is often not feasible to
             aggregate their routing information into the address space
             any one of those providers. Note that they still may receive
             their address allocation out of a transit domain's address
             space (which has other advantages), but their routing
             information must still be explicitly advertised by most of
             their service providers (the exception being that if the
             site's allocation comes out of its least-preferable service
             provider, then that service provider need not advertise the
             explicit route - longest-match will insure that its
             aggregated route is used to get to the site on a backup
             basis).  For this reason, the routing cost for these
             organizations will typically be about the same as it is
             today.
