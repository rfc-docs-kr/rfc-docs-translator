     The default minimum expected level of confidentiality for all new
     accounts MUST require successful validation of the server's
     certificate and SHOULD require negotiation of TLS version 1.1 or
     greater.  (Future revisions to this specification may raise these
     requirements or impose additional requirements to address newly
     discovered weaknesses in protocols or cryptographic algorithms.)
