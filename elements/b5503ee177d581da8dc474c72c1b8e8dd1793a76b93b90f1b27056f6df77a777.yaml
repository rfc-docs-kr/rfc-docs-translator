     Response messages contain only the subtrees selected by the filter.
     Any selection criteria that were present in the request, within a
     particular selected subtree, are also included in the response.  Note
     that some elements expressed in the filter as leaf nodes will be
     expanded (i.e., subtrees included) in the filter output.  Specific
     data instances are not duplicated in the response in the event that
     the request contains multiple filter subtree expressions that select
     the same data.
