                Specifically, the ARP exchange is completed in the usual
                manner using the normal IP protocol type, but a host that
                wants to speak trailers will send an additional "trailer
                ARP reply" packet, i.e., an ARP reply that specifies the
                trailer encapsulation protocol type but otherwise has the
                format of a normal ARP reply.  If a host configured to use
                trailers receives a trailer ARP reply message from a
                remote machine, it can add that machine to the list of
                machines that understand trailers, e.g., by marking the
                corresponding entry in the ARP cache.
