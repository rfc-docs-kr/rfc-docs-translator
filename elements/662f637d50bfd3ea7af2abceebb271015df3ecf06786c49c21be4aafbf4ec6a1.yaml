     It is therefore possible for an ASP to route signalling messages
     destined to the SS7 network using more than one SGP.  In this model,
     a Signalling Gateway is deployed as a cluster of hosts acting as a
     single SG.  A primary/backup redundancy model is possible, where the
     unavailability of the SCTP association to a primary SGP could be used
     to reroute affected traffic to an alternate SGP.  A loadsharing model
     is possible, where the signalling messages are loadshared between
     multiple SGPs.  A broadcast model is also possible, where signalling
     messages are sent to each active SGP in the SG.  The distribution of
     the MTP3-user messages over the SGPs should be done in such a way to
     minimize message missequencing, as required by the SS7 User Parts.
