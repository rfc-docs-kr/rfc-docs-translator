     At this point, we observe that the number of nodes at each lower
     level of a hierarchy tends to grow exponentially. Thus the greatest
     gains in the reachability information abstraction (for the benefit of
     all higher levels of the hierarchy) occur when the reachability
     information aggregation occurs near the leaves of the hierarchy; the
     gains drop significantly at each higher level. Therefore, the law of
     diminishing returns suggests that at some point data abstraction
     ceases to produce significant benefits. Determination of the point at
     which data abstraction ceases to be of benefit requires a careful
     consideration of the number of routing domains that are expected to
     occur at each level of the hierarchy (over a given period of time),
     compared to the number of routing domains and address prefixes that
     can conveniently and efficiently be handled via dynamic inter-domain
     routing protocols.
