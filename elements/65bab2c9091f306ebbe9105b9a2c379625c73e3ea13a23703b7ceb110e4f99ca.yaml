     This MIB is similar in design to [MODEL], although it can be used to
     build functional data paths that the model would not well describe.
     The model conceptually describes ingress and egress interfaces of an
     n-port router, which may find some interfaces at a network edge and
     others facing into the network core.  It describes the configuration
     and management of a Differentiated Services interface in terms of one
     or more Traffic Conditioning Blocks (TCB), each containing, arranged
     in the specified order, by definition, zero or more classifiers,
     meters, actions, algorithmic droppers, queues and schedulers.
     Traffic may be classified, and classified traffic may be metered.
     Each stream of traffic identified by a combination of classifiers and
     meters may have some set of actions performed on it; it may have
     dropping algorithms applied and it may ultimately be stored into a
     queue before being scheduled out to its next destination, either onto
     a link or to another TCB.  At times, the treatment for a given packet
     must have any of those elements repeated.  [MODEL] models this by
     cascading multiple TCBs, while this MIB describes the policy by
     directly linking the functional data path elements.
