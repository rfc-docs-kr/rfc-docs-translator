          (6) Compare the AS external path described by the LSA with the
              existing paths in N's routing table entry, as follows. If
              the new path is preferred, it replaces the present paths in
              N's routing table entry.  If the new path is of equal
              preference, it is added to N's routing table entry's list of
              paths.
