     An ICE TCP agent, full or lite, MUST be prepared to receive incoming
     TCP connection requests on the base of any TCP candidate that is
     simultaneous-open or passive.  When the connection request is
     received, the agent MUST accept it.  The agent MUST utilize the
     framing defined in RFC 4571 [RFC4571] for the lifetime of this
     connection.  Due to this framing, the agent will receive data in
     discrete frames.  Each frame could be media (such as RTP or SRTP),
     TLS, DTLS, or STUN packets.  The STUN packets are extracted as
     described in Section 10.2.
