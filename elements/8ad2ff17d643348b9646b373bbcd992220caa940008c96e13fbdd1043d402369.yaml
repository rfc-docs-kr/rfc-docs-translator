     A host receiving an EAP packet may only do one of three things with
     it: act on it, drop it, or forward it.  The forwarding decision is
     typically based only on examination of the Code, Identifier, and
     Length fields.  A pass-through authenticator implementation MUST be
     capable of forwarding EAP packets received from the peer with Code=2
     (Response) to the backend authentication server. It also MUST be
     capable of receiving EAP packets from the backend authentication
     server and forwarding EAP packets of Code=1 (Request), Code=3
     (Success), and Code=4 (Failure) to the peer.
