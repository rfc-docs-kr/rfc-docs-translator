     This memo discusses the strategy for address assignment of the
     existing 32-bit IPv4 address space with a view toward conserving the
     address space and limiting the growth rate of global routing state.
     This document obsoletes the original CIDR spec [RFC1519], with
     changes made both to clarify the concepts it introduced and, after
     more than twelve years, to update the Internet community on the
     results of deploying the technology described.
