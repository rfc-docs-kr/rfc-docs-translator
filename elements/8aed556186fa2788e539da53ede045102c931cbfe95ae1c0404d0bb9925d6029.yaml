        Clients do not typically have 'policies' as such, instead they
        rely on the user to define their actions and, to a certain extent,
        are reactive to the server policy.  Thus, a client will need to
        have commands that will allow the user to switch the protection
        level of the data connection dynamically; however, there may be a
        general 'policy' that attempts all LIST and NLST commands on a
        Clear connection first (and automatically switches to Private if
        it fails).  In this case, there would need to be a user command
        available to ensure that a given data transfer was not attempted
        on an insecure data connection.
