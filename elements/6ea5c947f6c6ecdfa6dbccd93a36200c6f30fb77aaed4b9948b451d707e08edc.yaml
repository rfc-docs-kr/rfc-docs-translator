     The Mark Action table is an unusual table, both in SNMP and in this
     MIB.  It might be viewed not so much as an array of single-object
     entries as an array of OBJECT-IDENTIFIER conventions, as the OID for
     a diffServDscpMarkActDscp instance conveys all of the necessary
     information: packets are to be marked with the requisite DSCP.
