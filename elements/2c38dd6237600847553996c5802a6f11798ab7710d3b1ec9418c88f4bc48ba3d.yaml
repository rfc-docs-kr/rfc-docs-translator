     Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines a mechanism for
     NAT traversal for multimedia communication protocols based on the
     offer/answer model of session negotiation.  ICE works by providing a
     set of candidate transport addresses for each media stream, which are
     then validated with peer-to-peer connectivity checks based on Session
     Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).  ICE provides a general framework
     for describing candidates but only defines UDP-based media streams.
     This specification extends ICE to TCP-based media, including the
     ability to offer a mix of TCP and UDP-based candidates for a single
     stream.
