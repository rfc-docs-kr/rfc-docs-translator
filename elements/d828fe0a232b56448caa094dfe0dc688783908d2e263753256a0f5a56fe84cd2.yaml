     We anticipate that the great majority of routing domains will be
     attached to only one of the TRDs. This will permit hierarchical
     address aggregation based on TRD. We therefore strongly recommend
     that addresses be assigned hierarchically, based on address prefixes
     assigned to individual TRDs.
