     Rule #1 guarantees that the routing algorithm used is consistent
     across implementations and consistent with other routing protocols,
     such as OSPF. Multi-homed networks are always explicitly advertised
     by every service provider through which they are routed even if they
     are a specific subset of one service provider's aggregate (if they
     are not, they clearly must be explicitly advertised). It may seem as
     if the "primary" service provider could advertise the multi-homed
     site implicitly as part of its aggregate, but the assumption that
     longest-match routing is always done causes this not to work.
