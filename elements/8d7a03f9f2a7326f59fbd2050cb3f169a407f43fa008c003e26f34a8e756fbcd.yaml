     The transitions are depicted as a result of the reception of ASP*M
     messages or other events.  In some of the transitions, there are some
     messages in brackets.  They mean that for a given node the state
     transition will be different, depending on its role: whether or not
     it is generating the ASP*M request message (i.e., ASPUP, ASPAC, ASPIA
     or ASPDN) or simply receiving it.  In a peer-to-peer based
     architecture (IPSP), this role may change between the peers.
