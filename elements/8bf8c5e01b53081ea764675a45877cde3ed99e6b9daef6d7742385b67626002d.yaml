     After a user's ability to authenticate to a server using cleartext is
     revoked, the server denying such access MUST NOT provide any
     indication over a cleartext channel of whether the user's
     authentication credentials were valid.  An attempt to authenticate as
     such a user using either invalid credentials or valid credentials
     MUST both result in the same indication of access being denied.
