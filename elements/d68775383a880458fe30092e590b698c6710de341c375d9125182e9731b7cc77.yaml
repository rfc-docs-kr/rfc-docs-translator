     In order for a Diameter node to perform failover procedures, it is
     necessary for the node to maintain a pending message queue for a
     given peer.  When an answer message is received, the corresponding
     request is removed from the queue.  The Hop-by-Hop Identifier field
     is used to match the answer with the queued request.
