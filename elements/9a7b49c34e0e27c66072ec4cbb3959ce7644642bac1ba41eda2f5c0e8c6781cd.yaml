        Note that in the SIPS URI scheme, transport is independent of TLS,
        and thus "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=tcp" and
        "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=sctp" are both valid (although
        note that UDP is not a valid transport for SIPS).  The use of
        "transport=tls" has consequently been deprecated, partly because
        it was specific to a single hop of the request.  This is a change
        since RFC 2543.

  - SIPS URI 체계에서 전송은 TLS와 독립적이므로 "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=tcp" 및 "sips:alice@atlanta.com;transport=sctp"는 모두 유효합니다(단, UDP는 SIPS에 대한 유효한 전송이 아닙니다. 결과적으로 "transport=tls" 사용은 요청의 단일 홉에만 국한되었기 때문에 더 이상 사용되지 않습니다. 이는 RFC 2543 이후 변경된 사항입니다.
