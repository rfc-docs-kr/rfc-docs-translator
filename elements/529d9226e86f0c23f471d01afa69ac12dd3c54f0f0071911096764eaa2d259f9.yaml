     A Notify message reflecting a change in the AS state MUST be sent to
     all ASPs in the AS, except those in the ASP-DOWN state, with
     appropriate Status Information and any ASP Identifier of the failed
     ASP.  At the ASP, Layer Management is informed with an M-NOTIFY
     indication primitive.  The Notify message must be sent whether the AS
     state change was a result of an ASP failure or receipt of an ASP
     State management (ASPSM) / ASP Traffic Management (ASPTM) message.
     In the second case, the Notify message MUST be sent after any related
     acknowledgement messages (e.g., ASP Up Ack, ASP Down Ack, ASP Active
     Ack, or ASP Inactive Ack).
