        The Hop-by-Hop Identifier is an unsigned 32-bit integer field (in
        network byte order) that aids in matching requests and replies.
        The sender MUST ensure that the Hop-by-Hop Identifier in a request
        is unique on a given connection at any given time, and it MAY
        attempt to ensure that the number is unique across reboots.  The
        sender of an answer message MUST ensure that the Hop-by-Hop
        Identifier field contains the same value that was found in the
        corresponding request.  The Hop-by-Hop Identifier is normally a
        monotonically increasing number, whose start value was randomly
        generated.  An answer message that is received with an unknown
        Hop-by-Hop Identifier MUST be discarded.
