     Given the nature of the Diameter protocol, it is recommended that
     transport failures be detected as soon as possible.  Detecting such
     failures will minimize the occurrence of messages sent to unavailable
     agents, resulting in unnecessary delays, and will provide better
     failover performance.  The Device-Watchdog-Request and Device-
     Watchdog-Answer messages, defined in this section, are used to pro-
     actively detect transport failures.
