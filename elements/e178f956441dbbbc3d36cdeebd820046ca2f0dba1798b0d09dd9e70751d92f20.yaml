          Tasking support
              Certain procedures described in this specification invoke
              other procedures.  At times, these other procedures should
              be executed in-line, that is, before the current procedure
              is finished.  This is indicated in the text by instructions
              to execute a procedure.  At other times, the other
              procedures are to be executed only when the current
              procedure has finished.  This is indicated by instructions
              to schedule a task.
