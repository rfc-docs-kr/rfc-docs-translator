        Note: [RFC1994] treats the shared secret as an octet string, and
        does not specify how it is entered into the system (or if it is
        handled by the user at all).  EAP MD5-Challenge implementations
        MAY support entering passphrases with non-ASCII characters.  See
        Section 5 for instructions how the input should be processed and
        encoded into octets.
