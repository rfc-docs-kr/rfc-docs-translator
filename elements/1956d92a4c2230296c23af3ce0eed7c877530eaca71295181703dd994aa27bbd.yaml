     The Result-Code AVP describes the error that the Diameter node
     encountered in its processing.  In case there are multiple errors,
     the Diameter node MUST report only the first error it encountered
     (detected possibly in some implementation-dependent order).  The
     specific errors that can be described by this AVP are described in
     the following section.
