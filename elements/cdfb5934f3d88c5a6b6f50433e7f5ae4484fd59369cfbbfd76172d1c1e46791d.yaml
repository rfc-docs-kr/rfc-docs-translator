     The agent sending the Internet Fax (which may include an onramp
     gateway) sends the digitally-signed S/MIME or OpenPGP Fax message to
     the offramp gateway.  The offramp gateway then compares the
     credentials of the user to determine if he/she is authorized to send
     faxes to the GSTN fax service.  If the authorization process fails,
     then the offramp gateway MUST generate an error delivery notification
     for the sender of the Internet Fax.
