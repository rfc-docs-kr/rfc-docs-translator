     Signalling Point Management Cluster (SPMC) - The complete set of
     Application Servers represented to the SS7 network under a single MTP
     entity (Signalling Point) in one specific Network Appearance.  SPMCs
     are used to aggregate the availability, congestion, and user part
     status of an MTP entity (Signalling Point) that is distributed in the
     IP domain, for the purpose of supporting MTP3 management procedures
     towards the SS7 network.  In some cases, the SG itself may also be a
     member of the SPMC.  In this case, the SG
     availability/congestion/User_Part status should also be taken into
     account when considering any supporting MTP3 management actions.
