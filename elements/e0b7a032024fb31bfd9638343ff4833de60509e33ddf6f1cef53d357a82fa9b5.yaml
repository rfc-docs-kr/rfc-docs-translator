     With a Bi-directional NAT, sessions can be initiated from hosts in
     the public network as well as the private network. Private network
     addresses are bound to globally unique addresses, statically or
     dynamically as connections are established in either direction.  The
     name space (i.e., their Fully Qualified Domain Names) between hosts
     in private and external networks is assumed to be end-to-end unique.
     Hosts in external realm access private realm hosts by using DNS for
     address resolution. A DNS-ALG must be employed in conjunction with
     Bi-Directional NAT to facilitate name to address mapping.
     Specifically, the DNS-ALG must be capable of translating private
     realm addresses in DNS Queries and responses into their external
     realm address bindings, and vice versa, as DNS packets traverse
     between private and external realms.
