     For purposes of discussion in this document, a session is defined as
     the set of traffic that is managed as a unit for translation.
     TCP/UDP sessions are uniquely identified by the tuple of (source IP
     address, source TCP/UDP port, target IP address, target TCP/UDP
     port). ICMP query sessions are identified by the tuple of (source IP
     address, ICMP query ID, target IP address). All other sessions are
     characterized by the tuple of (source IP address, target IP address,
     IP protocol).
