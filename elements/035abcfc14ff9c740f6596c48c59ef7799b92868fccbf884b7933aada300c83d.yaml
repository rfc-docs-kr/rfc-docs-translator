     Entities that receive a Transaction Pending shall switch to a
     different repetition timer for repeating requests.  The root
     termination has a property (ProvisionalResponseTimerValue), which
     can be set to the requested maximum number of milliseconds between
     receipt of a command and transmission of the TransactionPending
     response.  Upon receipt of a final response following receipt of
     provisional responses, an immediate confirmation shall be sent, and
     normal repetition timers shall be used thereafter.  An entity that
     sends a provisional response, SHALL include the immAckRequired field
     in the ensuing final response, indicating that an immediate
     confirmation is expected.  Receipt of a Transaction Pending after
     receipt of a reply shall be ignored.
