     The Diameter protocol allows AVP values of type 'Grouped'.  This
     implies that the Data field is actually a sequence of AVPs.  It is
     possible to include an AVP with a Grouped type within a Grouped type,
     that is, to nest them.  AVPs within an AVP of type Grouped have the
     same padding requirements as non-Grouped AVPs, as defined in
     Section 4.4.
