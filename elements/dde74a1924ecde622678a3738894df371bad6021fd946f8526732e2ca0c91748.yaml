              +  If SND.UNA < SEG.ACK =< SND.NXT, then set SND.UNA <-
                 SEG.ACK.  Any segments on the retransmission queue that
                 are thereby entirely acknowledged are removed.  Users
                 should receive positive acknowledgments for buffers that
                 have been SENT and fully acknowledged (i.e., SEND buffer
                 should be returned with "ok" response).  If the ACK is a
                 duplicate (SEG.ACK =< SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If
                 the ACK acks something not yet sent (SEG.ACK > SND.NXT),
                 then send an ACK, drop the segment, and return.
