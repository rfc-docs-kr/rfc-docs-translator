     If an ASP or group of ASPs is available to the SS7 network via more
     than one SG, each with its own Point Code, the ASP(s) will typically
     be represented by a Point Code that is separate from any SG Point
     Code.  This allows, for example, these SGs to be viewed from the SS7
     network as "STPs", each having an ongoing "route" to the same ASP(s).
     Under failure conditions where the ASP(s) become(s) unavailable from
     one of the SGs, this approach enables MTP3 route management messaging
     between the SG and SS7 network, allowing simple SS7 rerouting through
     an alternate SG without changing the Destination Point Code Address
     of SS7 traffic to the ASP(s).
