     EAP server
        The entity that terminates the EAP authentication method with the
        peer.  In the case where no backend authentication server is used,
        the EAP server is part of the authenticator.  In the case where
        the authenticator operates in pass-through mode, the EAP server is
        located on the backend authentication server.
