     Similarly, if a transit has been assigned address space from a class
     A network number, it is likely that it was not assigned the entire
     class A, and that other transit domains will get address space from
     this class A.  In this case, the transit would also have to inject
     routing information about the remainder of the class A into it's IGP.
     This is analogous to the situation above, with the same
     complications.  For this reason, we recommend that the use of a class
     A for CIDR only be attempted if IGP's with variable length subnet
     mask support be used throughout the class A.  Note that the IGP's
     need not support supernetting, as discussed above.
