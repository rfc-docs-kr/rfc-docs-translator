     Similarly, there are attacks on the transition between unprotected
     and TLS-protected traffic.  A number of IETF application protocols
     have used an application-level command, usually STARTTLS, to upgrade
     a cleartext connection to use TLS.  Multiple implementations of
     STARTTLS had a flaw where an application-layer input buffer retained
     commands that were pipelined with the STARTTLS command, such that
     commands received prior to TLS negotiation are executed after TLS
     negotiation.  This problem is resolved by requiring the application-
     level command input buffer to be empty before negotiating TLS.  Note
     that this flaw lives in the application layer code and does not
     impact the TLS protocol directly.
