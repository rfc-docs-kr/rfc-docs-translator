     The DUNA message is sent from an SGP in an SG to all concerned ASPs
     to indicate that the SG has determined that one or more SS7
     destinations are unreachable.  It is also sent by an SGP in response
     to a message from the ASP to an unreachable SS7 destination.  As an
     implementation option, the SG may suppress the sending of subsequent
     "response" DUNA messages regarding a certain unreachable SS7
     destination for a certain period to give the remote side time to
     react.  If there is no alternate route via another SG, the MTP3-User
     at the ASP is expected to stop traffic to the affected destination
     via the SG as per the defined MTP3-User procedures.
