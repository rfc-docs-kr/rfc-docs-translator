     The easiest way for the signing party to repudiate the message is by
     claiming that his private key has been compromised and that some
     attacker (though not necessarily the relying party) signed the
     disputed message.  In order to defend against this attack the relying
     party needs to demonstrate that the signing party's key had not been
     compromised at the time of the signature.  This requires substantial
     infrastructure, including archival storage of certificate revocation
     information and timestamp servers to establish the time that the
     message was signed.

  서명 당사자가 메시지를 거부하는 가장 쉬운 방법은 자신의 개인 키가 손상되었고 일부 공격자(반드시 신뢰 당사자는 아니지만)가 분쟁 메시지에 서명했다고 주장하는 것입니다. 이 공격을 방어하기 위해 신뢰 당사자는 서명 당시 서명 당사자의 키가 손상되지 않았음을 입증해야 합니다. 이를 위해서는 메시지가 서명된 시간을 설정하기 위한 인증서 해지 정보의 보관 저장소와 타임스탬프 서버를 포함한 상당한 인프라가 필요합니다.
