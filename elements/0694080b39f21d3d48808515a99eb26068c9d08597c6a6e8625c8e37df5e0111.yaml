                   It has been suggested that a host can augment its list
                   of default gateways by recording any new gateways it
                   learns about.  For example, it can record every gateway
                   to which it is ever redirected.  Such a feature, while
                   possibly useful in some circumstances, may cause
                   problems in other cases (e.g., gateways are not all
                   equal), and it is not recommended.
