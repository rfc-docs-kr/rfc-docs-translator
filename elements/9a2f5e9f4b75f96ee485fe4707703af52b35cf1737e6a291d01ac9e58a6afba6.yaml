     This specification was designed to be as similar to the AES-CCM ESP
     [CCM-ESP] and AES-CTR ESP [RFC3686] mechanisms as reasonable, while
     promoting simple, efficient implementations in both hardware and
     software.  We re-use the design and implementation experience from
     those standards.

  이 사양은 하드웨어와 소프트웨어 모두에서 간단하고 효율적인 구현을 촉진하면서 AES-CCM ESP [CCM-ESP] 및 AES-CTR ESP [RFC3686] 메커니즘과 합리적으로 유사하도록 설계되었습니다. 우리는 해당 표준의 설계 및 구현 경험을 재사용합니다.
