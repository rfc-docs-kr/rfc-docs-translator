          ________________________________________________________
          1      Router-LSAs        Originated by all routers.
                                    This LSA describes
                                    the collected states of the
                                    router's interfaces to an
                                    area. Flooded throughout a
                                    single area only.
          ________________________________________________________
          2      Network-LSAs       Originated for broadcast
                                    and NBMA networks by
                                    the Designated Router. This
                                    LSA contains the
                                    list of routers connected
                                    to the network. Flooded
                                    throughout a single area only.
          ________________________________________________________
          3,4    Summary-LSAs       Originated by area border
                                    routers, and flooded through-
                                    out the LSA's associated
                                    area. Each summary-LSA
                                    describes a route to a
                                    destination outside the area,
                                    yet still inside the AS
                                    (i.e., an inter-area route).
                                    Type 3 summary-LSAs describe
                                    routes to networks. Type 4
                                    summary-LSAs describe
                                    routes to AS boundary routers.
          ________________________________________________________
          5      AS-external-LSAs   Originated by AS boundary
                                    routers, and flooded through-
                                    out the AS. Each
                                    AS-external-LSA describes
                                    a route to a destination in
                                    another Autonomous System.
                                    Default routes for the AS can
                                    also be described by
                                    AS-external-LSAs.
