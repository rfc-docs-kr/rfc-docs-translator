     The TWAMP-Test AES Session-key is obtained as follows: the TWAMP-
     Control AES Session-key (the same AES Session-key as used for the
     corresponding TWAMP-Control session) is encrypted with the 16-octet
     session identifier (SID) as the key, using a single-block AES-ECB
     encryption.  The result is the TWAMP-Test AES Session-key to be used
     in encrypting (and decrypting) the packets of the particular TWAMP-
     Test session.  Note that the TWAMP-Test AES Session-key, TWAMP-
     Control AES Session-key, and the SID are all comprised of 16 octets.
