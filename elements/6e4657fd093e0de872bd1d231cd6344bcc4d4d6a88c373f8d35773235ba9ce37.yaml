     3. If an event is detected before the timer expires, it is mapped to
        a digit string symbol and provisionally added to the end of the
        current dial string.  The duration of the event (long or not long)
        is noted if and only if this is relevant in the current symbol
        position (because at least one of the candidate alternative event
        sequences includes the "Z" modifier at this position in the
        sequence).
