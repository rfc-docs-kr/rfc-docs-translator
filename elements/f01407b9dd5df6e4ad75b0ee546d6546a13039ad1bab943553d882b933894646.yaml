     If a media stream is inherently TCP-based, it is RECOMMENDED for an
     offering full agent to select an active candidate as the default
     candidate and use [RFC4145] "setup" attribute value "active".  This
     increases the chances for a successful NAT traversal even without ICE
     support if the agent is behind a NAT and the peer is not.  For the
     same reason, for a lite agent, it is RECOMMENDED to use a passive
     candidate and "setup" attribute value "passive" in the offer.
