        o  Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks may require more effort on ICN
           than on TCP/IP-based host-centric networks, but they are still
           feasible.  One reason for this is that it is difficult for the
           attacker to force repeated requests for the same content onto a
           single node; ICNs naturally spread content so that after the
           initial few requests, subsequent requests will generally be
           satisfied by alternative sources, blunting the impact of a DoS
           attack.  That said, there are many ways around this, e.g.,
           generating random suffix identifiers that always result in
           cache misses.
