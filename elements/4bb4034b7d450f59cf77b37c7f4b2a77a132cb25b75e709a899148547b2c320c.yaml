      Each router in the Autonomous System originates one or more link
      state advertisements (LSAs).  This memo defines five distinct types
      of LSAs, which are described in Section 4.3.  The collection of LSAs
      forms the link-state database.  Each separate type of LSA has a
      separate function.  Router-LSAs and network-LSAs describe how an
      area's routers and networks are interconnected.  Summary-LSAs
      provide a way of condensing an area's routing information.  AS-
      external-LSAs provide a way of transparently advertising
      externally-derived routing information throughout the Autonomous
      System.
