     It has been reported in [IMC05] that with the population of NATs
     deployed at the time of the measurements (2005), one of the NAT
     traversal techniques described here, TCP simultaneous-open, worked in
     roughly 45% of the cases.  Also, not all operating systems implement
     TCP simultaneous-open properly and thus are not able to use such
     candidates.  However, when more NATs comply with the requirements set
     by [RFC5382] and operating system TCP stacks are fixed, the success
     probability of simultaneous-open is likely to increase.  Also, it is
     important to implement additional techniques with higher success
     ratios, such as Teredo, whose success in different scenarios is
     described in Figure 1 of [RFC6081].
