     Such attacks can be mitigated by better protecting the private key,
     e.g., using OS protections or dedicated hardware.  Even more
     effective is the use of cipher suites that offer "forward secrecy",
     the property where revealing a secret such as a private key does not
     expose past or future sessions to a passive attacker.
