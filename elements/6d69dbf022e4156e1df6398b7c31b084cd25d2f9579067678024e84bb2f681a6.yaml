        In most cases, network topology will have a close relationship
        with national boundaries. For example, the degree of network
        connectivity will often be greater within a single country than
        between countries.  It is therefore appropriate to make specific
        recommendations based on national boundaries, with the
        understanding that there may be specific situations where these
        general recommendations need to be modified.
