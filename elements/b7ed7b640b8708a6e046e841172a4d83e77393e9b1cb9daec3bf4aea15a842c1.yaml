     Depending on the lower layer, these attacks may be carried out
     without requiring physical proximity.  Where EAP is used over
     wireless networks, EAP packets may be forwarded by authenticators
     (e.g., pre-authentication) so that the attacker need not be within
     the coverage area of an authenticator in order to carry out an attack
     on it or its peers.  Where EAP is used over the Internet, attacks may
     be carried out at an even greater distance.
