      o   Use of IP multicast.  Some OSPF messages are multicast, when
          sent over broadcast networks.  Two distinct IP multicast
          addresses are used.  Packets sent to these multicast addresses
          should never be forwarded; they are meant to travel a single hop
          only.  To ensure that these packets will not travel multiple
          hops, their IP TTL must be set to 1.
