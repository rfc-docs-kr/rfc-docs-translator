     When a priority scheduler is used, its effect is to give the queue
     the entire capacity of the subject interface less the capacity used
     by higher priorities, if there is traffic present to use it.  This is
     true regardless of the rate specifications applied to that queue or
     other queues on the interface.  Policing excess traffic will mitigate
     this behavior.
