              *    Active probes such as "pinging" (i.e., using an ICMP
                   Echo Request/Reply exchange) are expensive and scale
                   poorly.  In particular, hosts MUST NOT actively check
                   the status of a first-hop gateway by simply pinging the
                   gateway continuously.
