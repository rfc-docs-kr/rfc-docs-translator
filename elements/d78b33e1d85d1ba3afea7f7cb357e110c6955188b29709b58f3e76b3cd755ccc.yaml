     This model serves as an example.  M3UA imposes no restrictions as to
     the exact layout of the network elements, the message distribution
     algorithms, and the distribution of the signalling processes.
     Instead, it provides a framework and a set of messages that allow for
     a flexible and scalable signalling network architecture, aiming to
     provide reliability and performance.
