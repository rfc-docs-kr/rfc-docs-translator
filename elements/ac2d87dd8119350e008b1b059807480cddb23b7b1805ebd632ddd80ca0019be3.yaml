          OSPF routes IP packets based solely on the destination IP
          address found in the IP packet header.  IP packets are routed
          "as is" -- they are not encapsulated in any further protocol
          headers as they transit the Autonomous System.  OSPF is a
          dynamic routing protocol.  It quickly detects topological
          changes in the AS (such as router interface failures) and
          calculates new loop-free routes after a period of convergence.
          This period of convergence is short and involves a minimum of
          routing traffic.
