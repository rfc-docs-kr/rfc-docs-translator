     An access device can also include the Origin-State-Id in request
     messages other than the CER if there are relays or proxies in between
     the access device and the server.  In this case, however, the server
     cannot discover that the access device has been restarted unless and
     until it receives a new request from it.  Therefore, this mechanism
     is more opportunistic across proxies and relays.
