      Figure 9 shows the collection of data structures present in a
      typical router.  The router pictured is RT10, from the map in Figure
      6.  Note that Router RT10 has a virtual link configured to Router
      RT11, with Area 2 as the link's Transit area.  This is indicated by
      the dashed line in Figure 9.  When the virtual link becomes active,
      through the building of the shortest path tree for Area 2, it
      becomes an interface to the backbone (see the two backbone
      interfaces depicted in Figure 9).
