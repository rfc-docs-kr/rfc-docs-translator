     It is possible that truncated MACs are weaker than "un-truncated"
     MACs.  However, no significant weaknesses are currently known or
     expected to exist for HMAC with MD5 or SHA-1, truncated to 80 bits.

  잘린 MAC은 "잘리지 않은" MAC보다 약할 수 있습니다. 그러나 80비트로 잘린 MD5 또는 SHA-1을 사용하는 HMAC에는 현재 알려진 심각한 약점이 없거나 존재할 것으로 예상되지 않습니다.
