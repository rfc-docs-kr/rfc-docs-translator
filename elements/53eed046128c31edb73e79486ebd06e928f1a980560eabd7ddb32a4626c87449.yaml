        Accounting-Request packets are sent from a client (typically a
        Network Access Server or its proxy) to a RADIUS accounting server,
        and convey information used to provide accounting for a service
        provided to a user.  The client transmits a RADIUS packet with the
        Code field set to 4 (Accounting-Request).
