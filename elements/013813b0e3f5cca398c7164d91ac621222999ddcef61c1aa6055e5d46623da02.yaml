      Link ID
          Identifies the object that this router link connects to.  Value
          depends on the link's Type.  When connecting to an object that
          also originates an LSA (i.e., another router or a transit
          network) the Link ID is equal to the neighboring LSA's Link
          State ID.  This provides the key for looking up the neighboring
          LSA in the link state database during the routing table
          calculation. See Section 12.2 for more details.
