     New Sections 5.1 through 5.3 are almost identical to their
     counterparts in RFC 2527.  The remainder of the new Section 5 is the
     topics moved from RFC 2527's Section 4, in the order that they
     appeared in Section 4.  Section 6 of the new framework is almost the
     same as the old Section 6, with some exceptions, such as the
     consolidation of old Section 6.8 (cryptographic module engineering
     controls) into Section 6.2.1 (now called "cryptographic module
     standards and controls") and the addition of time-stamping in a new
     Section 6.8.  Section 7 is almost identical to the old Section 7, the
     major change being the addition of a section covering OCSP profile.
     Section 8 is almost identical to RFC 2527's Section 2.7.

  새로운 섹션 5.1부터 5.3은 RFC 2527의 해당 항목과 거의 동일합니다. 새로운 섹션 5의 나머지 부분은 섹션 4에 나타난 순서대로 RFC 2527의 섹션 4에서 이동된 주제입니다. 새 프레임워크의 섹션 6은 거의 이전 섹션 6.8(암호화 모듈 엔지니어링 제어)을 섹션 6.2.1(현재 "암호화 모듈 표준 및 제어"라고 함)로 통합하고 새로운 섹션 6.8. 섹션 7은 이전 섹션 7과 거의 동일하며 주요 변경 사항은 OCSP 프로필을 다루는 섹션이 추가된 것입니다. 섹션 8은 RFC 2527의 섹션 2.7과 거의 동일합니다.
