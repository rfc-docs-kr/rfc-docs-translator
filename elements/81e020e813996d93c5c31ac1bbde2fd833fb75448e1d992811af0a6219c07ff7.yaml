     Diameter clients MUST support the base protocol, which includes
     accounting.  In addition, they MUST fully support each Diameter
     application that is needed to implement the client's service, e.g.,
     Network Access Server Requirements (NASREQ) [RFC2881] and/or Mobile
     IPv4.  A Diameter client MUST be referred to as "Diameter X Client"
     where X is the application that it supports and not a "Diameter
     Client".
