     IPsec techniques which are intended to preserve the Endpoint
     addresses of an IP packet will not work with NAT enroute for most
     applications in practice. Techniques such as AH and ESP protect the
     contents of the IP headers (including the source and destination
     addresses) from modification. Yet, NAT's fundamental role is to alter
     the addresses in the IP header of a packet.
