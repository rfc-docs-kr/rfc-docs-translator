           DISCUSSION:
                These rules will prevent the "broadcast storms" that have
                resulted from hosts returning ICMP error messages in
                response to broadcast datagrams.  For example, a broadcast
                UDP segment to a non-existent port could trigger a flood
                of ICMP Destination Unreachable datagrams from all
                machines that do not have a client for that destination
                port.  On a large Ethernet, the resulting collisions can
                render the network useless for a second or more.
