                   segments are originally sent and to queue these
                   segments in a "retransmission queue" until they are
                   acknowledged.  Another design (which may be simpler) is
                   to defer packetizing until each time data is
                   transmitted or retransmitted, so there will be no
                   segment retransmission queue.
