     Once a peer has sent a Response of the same Type as the initial
     Request, an authenticator MUST NOT send a Request of a different Type
     prior to completion of the final round of a given method (with the
     exception of a Notification-Request) and MUST NOT send a Request for
     an additional method of any Type after completion of the initial
     authentication method; a peer receiving such Requests MUST treat them
     as invalid, and silently discard them.  As a result, Identity Requery
     is not supported.
