     | Value | Symbolic Name and Description                             |
     +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
     | '3'   | 'portrait': The content will be imaged across the short   |
     |       | edge of the medium.                                       |
     +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
     | '4'   | 'landscape': The content will be imaged across the long   |
     |       | edge of the medium.  Landscape is defined to be a         |
     |       | rotation of the Input Page to be imaged by +90 degrees    |
     |       | with respect to the medium (i.e., counterclockwise) from  |
     |       | the portrait orientation.  Note: The +90 direction was    |
     |       | chosen because simple finishing on the long edge is the   |
     |       | same edge whether portrait or landscape.                  |
     +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
     | '5'   | 'reverse-landscape': The content will be imaged across    |
     |       | the long edge of the medium.  Reverse-landscape is        |
     |       | defined to be a rotation of the Input Page to be imaged   |
     |       | by -90 degrees with respect to the medium (i.e.,          |
     |       | clockwise) from the portrait orientation.  Note: The      |
     |       | 'reverse-landscape' value was added because some          |
     |       | applications rotate landscape -90 degrees from portrait,  |
     |       | rather than +90 degrees.                                  |
     +-------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
     | '6'   | 'reverse-portrait': The content will be imaged across the |
     |       | short edge of the medium.  Reverse-portrait is defined to |
     |       | be a rotation of the Input Page to be imaged by 180       |
     |       | degrees with respect to the medium from the portrait      |
     |       | orientation.  Note: The 'reverse-portrait' value was      |
     |       | added for use with the "finishings" attribute in cases    |
     |       | where the opposite edge is desired for finishing a        |
     |       | portrait Document on simple finishing devices that have   |
     |       | only one finishing position.  Thus, a 'text'/plain'       |
     |       | portrait Document can be stapled "on the right" by a      |
     |       | simple finishing device, as is common use with some       |
     |       | Middle Eastern languages such as Hebrew.                  |
