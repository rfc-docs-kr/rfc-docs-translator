     If a Diameter connection is to be protected via TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP
     or IPsec, then TLS/TCP and DTLS/SCTP or IPsec/IKE SHOULD begin prior
     to any Diameter message exchange.  All security parameters for TLS/
     TCP and DTLS/SCTP or IPsec are configured independent of the Diameter
     protocol.  All Diameter messages will be sent through the TLS/TCP and
     DTLS/SCTP or IPsec connection after a successful setup.
