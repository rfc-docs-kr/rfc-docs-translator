          Section 2 of this document discusses the directed graph
          representation of an area.  Router nodes are labelled with their
          Router ID.  Transit network nodes are actually labelled with the
          IP address of their Designated Router.  It follows that when the
          Designated Router changes, it appears as if the network node on
          the graph is replaced by an entirely new node.  This will cause
          the network and all its attached routers to originate new LSAs.
          Until the link-state databases again converge, some temporary
          loss of connectivity may result.  This may result in ICMP
          unreachable messages being sent in response to data traffic.
          For that reason, the Designated Router should change only
          infrequently.  Router Priorities should be configured so that
          the most dependable router on a network eventually becomes
          Designated Router.
