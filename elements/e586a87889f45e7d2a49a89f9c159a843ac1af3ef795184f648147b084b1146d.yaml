     $ subordinate DN
        (I) An X.500 DN is subordinate to another X.500 DN if it begins
        with a set of attributes that is the same as the entire second DN
        except for the terminal attribute of the second DN (which is
        usually the name of a CA). For example, the DN <C=FooLand, O=Gov,
        OU=Treasurer, CN=DukePinchpenny> is subordinate to the DN
        <C=FooLand, O=Gov, CN=KingFooCA>.
