              Figure 2 shows a sample map of an Autonomous System.  The
              rectangle labelled H1 indicates a host, which has a SLIP
              connection to Router RT12.  Router RT12 is therefore
              advertising a host route.  Lines between routers indicate
              physical point-to-point networks.  The only point-to-point
              network that has been assigned interface addresses is the
              one joining Routers RT6 and RT10.  Routers RT5 and RT7 have
              BGP connections to other Autonomous Systems.  A set of BGP-
              learned routes have been displayed for both of these
              routers.
