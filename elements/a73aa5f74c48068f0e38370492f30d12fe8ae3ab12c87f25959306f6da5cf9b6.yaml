              If a Source Quench message is received, the IP layer MUST
              report it to the transport layer (or ICMP processing). In
              general, the transport or application layer SHOULD implement
              a mechanism to respond to Source Quench for any protocol
              that can send a sequence of datagrams to the same
              destination and which can reasonably be expected to maintain
              enough state information to make this feasible.  See Section
              4 for the handling of Source Quench by TCP and UDP.
