        (f)  Obtain and validate the certification path for the issuer of
             the complete CRL.  The trust anchor for the certification
             path MUST be the same as the trust anchor used to validate
             the target certificate.  If a key usage extension is present
             in the CRL issuer's certificate, verify that the cRLSign bit
             is set.
