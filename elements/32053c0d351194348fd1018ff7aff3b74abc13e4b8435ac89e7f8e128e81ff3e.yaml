     Since PUSH_PROMISE reserves a stream, ignoring a PUSH_PROMISE frame
     causes the stream state to become indeterminate.  A receiver MUST
     treat the receipt of a PUSH_PROMISE on a stream that is neither
     "open" nor "half-closed (local)" as a connection error
     (Section 5.4.1) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.  However, an endpoint that
     has sent RST_STREAM on the associated stream MUST handle PUSH_PROMISE
     frames that might have been created before the RST_STREAM frame is
     received and processed.

  PUSH_PROMISE는 스트림을 예약하므로 PUSH_PROMISE 프레임을 무시하면 스트림 상태가 불확실해집니다. 수신자는 "개방" 또는 "반 폐쇄(로컬)"가 아닌 스트림에서 PUSH_PROMISE 수신을 PROTOCOL_ERROR 유형의 연결 오류(5.4.1절)로 처리해야 합니다. 그러나 관련 스트림에서 RST_STREAM을 보낸 엔드포인트는 RST_STREAM 프레임이 수신되고 처리되기 전에 생성되었을 수 있는 PUSH_PROMISE 프레임을 처리해야 합니다.
