     8. ServiceChange. The ServiceChange Command allows the Media Gateway
        to notify the Media Gateway Controller that a Termination or group
        of Terminations is about to be taken out of service or has just
        been returned to service.   ServiceChange is also used by the MG
        to announce its availability to an MGC (registration), and to
        notify the MGC of impending or completed restart of the MG. The
        MGC may announce a handover to the MG by sending it a
        ServiceChange command.  The MGC may also use ServiceChange to
        instruct the MG to take a Termination or group of Terminations in
        or out of service.
