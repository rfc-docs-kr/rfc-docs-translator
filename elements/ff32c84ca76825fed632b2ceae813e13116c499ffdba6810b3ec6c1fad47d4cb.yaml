              Status  Set to either Advertise or DoNotAdvertise.  Routing
                      information is condensed at area boundaries.
                      External to the area, at most a single route is
                      advertised (via a summary-LSA) for each address
                      range. The route is advertised if and only if the
                      address range's Status is set to Advertise.
                      Unadvertised ranges allow the existence of certain
                      networks to be intentionally hidden from other
                      areas. Status is set to Advertise by default.
