          After a neighbor has been discovered, bidirectional
          communication ensured, and (if on a broadcast or NBMA network) a
          Designated Router elected, a decision is made regarding whether
          or not an adjacency should be formed with the neighbor (see
          Section 10.4). If an adjacency is to be formed, the first step
          is to synchronize the neighbors' link-state databases.  This is
          covered in the next section.
