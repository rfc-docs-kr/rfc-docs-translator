     DNAv4 does not significantly increase the likelihood of an address
     conflict.  The reachability test is only carried out for a network
     when the host has previously completed conflict detection as
     recommended in Section 2.2 of the DHCP specification [RFC2131] and
     obtained an operable IPv4 configuration on that network.
     Restrictions on sending ARP Requests and Responses are described in
     Section 2.1.1.
