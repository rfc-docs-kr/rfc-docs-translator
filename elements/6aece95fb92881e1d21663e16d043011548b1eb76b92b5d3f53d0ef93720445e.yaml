                        Even if the sender is using the Nagle Algorithm,
                        when a TCP connection carries remote login traffic
                        across a low-delay LAN the receiver will generally
                        get a stream of single-character segments.  If
                        remote terminal echo mode is in effect, the
                        receiver's system will generally echo each
                        character as it is received.
