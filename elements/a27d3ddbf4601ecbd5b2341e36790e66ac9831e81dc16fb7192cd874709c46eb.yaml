     *  To enable the address-based protection, the MGC must obtain the
        remote session description of the egress MG and pass it to the
        ingress MG.  This requires at least one network roundtrip, and
        leaves us with a dilemma: either allow the call to proceed without
        waiting for the round trip to complete, and risk for example,
        "clipping" a remote announcement, or wait for the full roundtrip
        and settle for slower call-set-up procedures.
