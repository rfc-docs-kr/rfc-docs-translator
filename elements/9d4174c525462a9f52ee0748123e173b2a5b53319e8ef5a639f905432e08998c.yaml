     modify an authorization answer, converting the result from success to
     failure, prior to forwarding the message to the access device.  If
     the answer did not contain an Auth-Session-State AVP with the value
     NO_STATE_MAINTAINED, a proxy that causes an authorized session not to
     be started MUST issue an STR to the Diameter server that authorized
     the session, since the access device has no way of knowing that the
     session had been authorized.
