          The backbone enables the exchange of summary information between
          area border routers.  Every area border router hears the area
          summaries from all other area border routers.  It then forms a
          picture of the distance to all networks outside of its area by
          examining the collected LSAs, and adding in the backbone
          distance to each advertising router.
