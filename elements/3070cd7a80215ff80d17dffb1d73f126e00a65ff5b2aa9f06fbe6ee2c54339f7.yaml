           o  If the RST bit is set, then any outstanding RECEIVEs and
              SEND should receive "reset" responses.  All segment queues
              should be flushed.  Users should also receive an unsolicited
              general "connection reset" signal.  Enter the CLOSED state,
              delete the TCB, and return.
