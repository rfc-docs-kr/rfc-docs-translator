              A host MAY implement a "half-duplex" TCP close sequence, so
              that an application that has called CLOSE cannot continue to
              read data from the connection.  If such a host issues a
              CLOSE call while received data is still pending in TCP, or
              if new data is received after CLOSE is called, its TCP
              SHOULD send a RST to show that data was lost.
