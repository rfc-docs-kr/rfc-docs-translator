     If a protocol server provides service for more than one mail domain,
     it MAY use a separate IP address for each domain and/or a server
     certificate that advertises multiple domains.  This will generally be
     necessary unless and until it is acceptable to impose the constraint
     that the server and all clients support the Server Name Indication
     (SNI) extension to TLS [RFC6066].  Mail servers supporting the SNI
     need to support the post-SRV hostname to interoperate with MUAs that
     have not implemented [RFC6186].  For more discussion of this problem,
     see Section 5.1 of [RFC7817].
