     If the value of a Reserve property is False, the MG SHALL choose one
     of the alternatives specified in the local descriptor (if present)
     and one of the alternatives specified in the remote descriptor (if
     present).  If the MG has not yet reserved resources to support the
     selected alternative, it SHALL reserve the resources.  If, on the
     other hand, it already reserved resources for the Termination
     addressed (because of a prior exchange with ReserveValue and/or
     ReserveGroup equal to True), it SHALL release any excess resources it
     reserved previously.  Finally, the MG shall send a reply to the MGC
     containing the alternatives for the local and/or remote descriptor
     that it selected.  If the MG does not have sufficient resources to
     support any of the alternatives specified, is SHALL respond with
     error 510 (insufficient resources).
