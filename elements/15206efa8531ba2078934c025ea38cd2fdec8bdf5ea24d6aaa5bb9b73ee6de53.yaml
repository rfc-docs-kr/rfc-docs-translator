              An application program is logically required to set the PUSH
              flag in a SEND call whenever it needs to force delivery of
              the data to avoid a communication deadlock.  However, a TCP
              SHOULD send a maximum-sized segment whenever possible, to
              improve performance (see Section 4.2.3.4).
