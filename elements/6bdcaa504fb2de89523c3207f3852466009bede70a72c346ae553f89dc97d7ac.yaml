     These recent results are on the verge of becoming practically
     exploitable; currently they require 2^26 sessions or 13x2^30
     encryptions.  As a result, RC4 can no longer be seen as providing a
     sufficient level of security for TLS sessions.  For further details,
     the reader is referred to [CIPHER-SUITES] and the references it
     cites.
