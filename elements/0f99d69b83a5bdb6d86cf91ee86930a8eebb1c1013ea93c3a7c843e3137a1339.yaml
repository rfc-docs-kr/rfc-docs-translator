        The data contains arbitrary data of variable length.  Unless
        otherwise noted, the AVP Length field MUST be set to at least 8
        (12 if the 'V' bit is enabled).  AVP values of this type that are
        not a multiple of 4 octets in length are followed by the necessary
        padding so that the next AVP (if any) will start on a 32-bit
        boundary.
