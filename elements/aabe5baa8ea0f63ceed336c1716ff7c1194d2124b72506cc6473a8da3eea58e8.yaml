     SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
     Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
     even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
     allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
     in this MIB module.

  SNMPv3 이전의 SNMP 버전에는 적절한 보안이 포함되지 않았습니다. 네트워크 자체가 안전하더라도(예: IPSec 사용) 보안 네트워크의 누가 액세스하고 이 개체에 대한 GET/SET(읽기/변경/생성/삭제)을 허용할지에 대한 제어는 없습니다. MIB 모듈.
