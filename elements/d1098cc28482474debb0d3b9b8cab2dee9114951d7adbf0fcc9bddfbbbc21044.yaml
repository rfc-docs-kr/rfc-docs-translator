     The RC4 algorithm [RC4] has been used with TLS (and previously, SSL)
     for many years.  RC4 has long been known to have a variety of
     cryptographic weaknesses, e.g., [RC4-Attack-Pau], [RC4-Attack-Man],
     and [RC4-Attack-FMS].  Recent cryptanalysis results [RC4-Attack-AlF]
     exploit biases in the RC4 keystream to recover repeatedly encrypted
     plaintexts.
