     Certain sections of the document borrowed heavily from IDRP
     [IS10747], which is the OSI counterpart of BGP.  For this, credit
     should be given to the ANSI X3S3.3 group chaired by Lyman Chapin and
     to Charles Kunzinger, who was the IDRP editor within that group.

  문서의 특정 섹션은 BGP의 OSI 버전인 IDRP [IS10747]에서 많이 차용했습니다. 이에 대해서는 Lyman Chapin이 의장을 맡은 ANSI X3S3.3 그룹과 해당 그룹 내 IDRP 편집자였던 Charles Kunzinger에게 공을 돌립니다.
