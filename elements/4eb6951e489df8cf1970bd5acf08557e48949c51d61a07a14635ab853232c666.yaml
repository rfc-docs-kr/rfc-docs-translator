                 Setting this object to the value invalid(2) has the
                 effect of invalidating the corresponding entry in the
                 ipForwardTable object.  That is, it effectively
                 disassociates the destination identified with said
                 entry from the route identified with said entry.  It is
                 an implementation-specific matter as to whether the
                 agent removes an invalidated entry from the table.
                 Accordingly, management stations must be prepared to
                 receive tabular information from agents that
                 corresponds to entries not currently in use.  Proper
                 interpretation of such entries requires examination of
                 the relevant ipForwardType object."
