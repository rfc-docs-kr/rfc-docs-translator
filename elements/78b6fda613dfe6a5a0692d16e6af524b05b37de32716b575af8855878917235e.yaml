                    There are actually three possible actions if LF < MTU.
                    First is the one required for this specification
                    (reject the frame).  Second is to reduce the MTU for
                    all hosts to equal the LF.  And, third is to keep a
                    separate MTU per communicating host based on the
                    received LFs.
