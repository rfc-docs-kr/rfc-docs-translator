                  o   Else, there has been a Designated Router elected for
                      the attached network.  If the router is fully
                      adjacent to the Designated Router, or if the router
                      itself is Designated Router and is fully adjacent to
                      at least one other router, add a single Type 2 link
                      (transit network) with Link ID set to the IP
                      interface address of the attached network's
                      Designated Router (which may be the router itself),
                      Link Data set to the router's own IP interface
                      address, and cost equal to the interface's
                      configured output cost.  Otherwise, add a link as if
                      the interface state were Waiting (see above).
