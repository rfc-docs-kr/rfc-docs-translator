           o  If the SYN bit is set in these synchronized states, it may
              be either a legitimate new connection attempt (e.g., in the
              case of TIME-WAIT), an error where the connection should be
              reset, or the result of an attack attempt, as described in
              RFC 5961 [9].  For the TIME-WAIT state, new connections can
              be accepted if the Timestamp Option is used and meets
              expectations (per [40]).  For all other cases, RFC 5961
              provides a mitigation with applicability to some situations,
              though there are also alternatives that offer cryptographic
              protection (see Section 7).  RFC 5961 recommends that in
              these synchronized states, if the SYN bit is set,
              irrespective of the sequence number, TCP endpoints MUST send
              a "challenge ACK" to the remote peer:
