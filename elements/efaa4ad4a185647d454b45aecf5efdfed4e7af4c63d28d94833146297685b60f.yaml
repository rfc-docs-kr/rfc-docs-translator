          (3) Calculate the new Designated Router for the network as
              follows.  If one or more of the routers have declared
              themselves Designated Router (i.e., they are currently
              listing themselves as Designated Router in their Hello
              Packets) the one having highest Router Priority is declared
              to be Designated Router.  In case of a tie, the one having
              the highest Router ID is chosen.  If no routers have
              declared themselves Designated Router, assign the Designated
              Router to be the same as the newly elected Backup Designated
              Router.
