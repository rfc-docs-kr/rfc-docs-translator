     The 304 (Not Modified) status code indicates that a conditional GET
     or HEAD request has been received and would have resulted in a 200
     (OK) response if it were not for the fact that the condition
     evaluated to false.  In other words, there is no need for the server
     to transfer a representation of the target resource because the
     request indicates that the client, which made the request
     conditional, already has a valid representation; the server is
     therefore redirecting the client to make use of that stored
     representation as if it were the content of a 200 (OK) response.

  304(수정되지 않음) 상태 코드는 조건부 GET 또는 HEAD 요청이 수신되었으며 조건이 false로 평가되지 않았다면 200(OK) 응답이 발생했음을 나타냅니다. 즉, 요청을 조건부로 만든 클라이언트가 이미 유효한 표현을 가지고 있음을 요청이 나타내기 때문에 서버가 대상 리소스의 표현을 전송할 필요가 없습니다. 따라서 서버는 마치 200(OK) 응답의 내용인 것처럼 저장된 표현을 사용하도록 클라이언트를 리디렉션합니다.
