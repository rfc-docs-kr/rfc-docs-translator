        IEEE 802.5 networks have a maximum packet size based on the
        maximum time a node may hold the token.  This time depends on many
        factors including the data signalling rate and the number of nodes
        on the ring.  The determination of maximum packet size becomes
        even more complex when multi-ring networks with bridges are
        considered.
