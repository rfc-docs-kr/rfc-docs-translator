     Cryptographic Separation
        Two keys (x and y) are "cryptographically separate" if an
        adversary that knows all messages exchanged in the protocol cannot
        compute x from y or y from x without "breaking" some cryptographic
        assumption.  In particular, this definition allows that the
        adversary has the knowledge of all nonces sent in cleartext, as
        well as all predictable counter values used in the protocol.
        Breaking a cryptographic assumption would typically require
        inverting a one-way function or predicting the outcome of a
        cryptographic pseudo-random number generator without knowledge of
        the secret state.  In other words, if the keys are
        cryptographically separate, there is no shortcut to compute x from
        y or y from x, but the work an adversary must do to perform this
        computation is equivalent to performing an exhaustive search for
        the secret state value.
