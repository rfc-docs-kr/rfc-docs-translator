           AS path information can be represented as ordered AS_SEQUENCEs
           or unordered AS_SETs.  AS_SETs are used in the route
           aggregation algorithm described in Section 9.2.2.2.  They
           reduce the size of the AS_PATH information by listing each AS
           number only once, regardless of how many times it may have
           appeared in multiple AS_PATHs that were aggregated.

  - AS 경로 정보는 순서가 있는 AS_SEQUENCE 또는 순서가 없는 AS_SET으로 표현될 수 있습니다. AS_SET은 섹션 9.2.2.2에 설명된 경로 집합 알고리즘에 사용됩니다. 집계된 여러 AS_PATH에 나타나는 횟수에 관계없이 각 AS 번호를 한 번만 나열하여 AS_PATH 정보의 크기를 줄입니다.
