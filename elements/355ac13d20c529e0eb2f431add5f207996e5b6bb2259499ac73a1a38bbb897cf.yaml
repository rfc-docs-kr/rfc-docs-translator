              DISCUSSION:
                   Many TCP implementations become confused if the window
                   shrinks from the right after data has been sent into a
                   larger window.  Note that TCP has a heuristic to select
                   the latest window update despite possible datagram
                   reordering; as a result, it may ignore a window update
                   with a smaller window than previously offered if
                   neither the sequence number nor the acknowledgment
                   number is increased.
