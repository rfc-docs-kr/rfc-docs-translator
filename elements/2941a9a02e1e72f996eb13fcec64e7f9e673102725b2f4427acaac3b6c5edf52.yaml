                      Otherwise, the new neighbor state is Loading.  Start
                      (or continue) sending Link State Request packets to
                      the neighbor (see Section 10.9).  These are requests
                      for the neighbor's more recent LSAs (which were
                      discovered but not yet received in the Exchange
                      state).  These LSAs are listed in the Link state
                      request list associated with the neighbor.
