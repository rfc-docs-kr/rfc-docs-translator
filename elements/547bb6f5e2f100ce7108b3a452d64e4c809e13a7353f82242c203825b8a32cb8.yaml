     A quoted-string is treated as a unit.  That is, quoted-string is
     identical to atom, semantically.  Since a quoted-string is allowed to
     contain FWS, folding is permitted.  Also note that since quoted-pair
     is allowed in a quoted-string, the quote and backslash characters may
     appear in a quoted-string so long as they appear as a quoted-pair.

  인용 문자열은 하나의 단위로 처리됩니다.  즉, quoted-string은 의미상 원자와 동일합니다.  인용 문자열에는 FWS가 포함될 수 있으므로 접는 것이 허용됩니다.  또한 quoted-string에서 quoted-pair가 허용되므로 quoted-string으로 나타나는 한 quote와 backslash 문자가 quoted-string에 나타날 수 있습니다.
