        bridges.  However, these "copies" will have taken different routes
        so the contents of the RIF will differ.  An implementation of ARP
        in this context must determine which of these "copies" to use and
        to ignore the others.  There are three obvious and legal
        strategies: (1) take the first and ignore the rest (that is, once
        you have an entry in the ARP cache don't change it), (2) take the
        last, (that is, always up date the ARP cache with the latest ARP
        message), or (3) take the one with the shortest path, (that is,
        replace the ARP cache information with the latest ARP message data
        if it is a shorter route).  Since there is no problem of
        incompatibility for interworking of different implementations if
        different strategies are chosen, the choice is up to each
        implementor.  The recipient of the ARP request must send an ARP
        reply as a point to point message using the RIF information.
